<p>The Diary of Seth J. Wells from June 14th,
1861, to July 9th, 1864, relates to the every day life
of the soldier in camp and field and records its
tramps and hardships cheerfully borne.</p>

<p>The Siege of Vicksburg is taken from the Diary.</p>

<p>He was born on April 26th 1842 in Iowa, Des
Moines County, near the village of Rising Sun
and was reared in his Grandfather Ewell’s family
on the “Ewell Farms” in Michigan, Macomb
County, near the village of Utica.</p>

<p>He was wounded in battle and died a few days
later in a hospital at Vicksburg on July 9th 1864.
He enlisted on June 12th 1861 and served in three
companies of the United States Army during the
Civil War: Company E, 12th Indiana; Company
K, 17th Illinois; Company G, 8th Illinois. The
brothers, Frank and Seth, were together in Company
K, 17th Illinois.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunlap Springs, Nov.</span> 3, 1862. We have built a
snug log house and last night for the first and
probably last time have slept in it; for our company
has orders to move down town and act as
city guards. There are eight or ten regiments here,
some of them new ones from Jackson, Miss. The
new regiments, like all new ones, have great confidence
in themselves and think the war is to be
settled by them and them only. There is an undercurrent
of jealousy existing between the old and
new troops. The old troops call the new ones
“forty dollar men,” “bounty men,” and “home
guards.” Last Friday, Oct. 31, we had general review
from Gen. McPherson who is here commanding
the post. There were twenty regiments, ten
thousand men, I should judge, on the field. There
is a great forward movement taking place. All the
troops started out on the Grand Junction road this
morning with the exception of the 43rd, and 17th
Ill. The weather is fine, the days are warm and
pleasant, but the nights are very cold and frosty.
About once in ten days we have a northeast rainstorm,
followed by cold weather and sleet. We are
on guard every other day, sometimes every third
day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov. 7.</span> We got a buggy shed from the citizens,
boarded it up tight, built a furnace in it, and were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
just putting on the finishing touches, (battening
up the cracks with cotton) when we received
marching orders. Such is the fortune of war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov. 8.</span> We struck our tents and started for
Grand Junction about 10 o’clock. The boys are
in fine health and spirits. We marched about nine
miles and camped by a clear spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov. 9.</span> Sunday. We marched about fifteen
miles today and arrived at LaGrange, three miles
west of Grand Junction. It is dry and very dusty.
Sometimes the dust was so thick we could not see
the ground. That and the smoke and heat from
the burning fences was almost intolerable. We
passed miles and miles of burnt and burning fences,
fired by troops in advance. Large and fine farms
and plantations were laid waste. We met fully
forty teams of four and six mules each, loaded with
wenches and young woolly heads, and all their
personal effects, and in fact all they could smuggle
from their masters. Ask them where they are
going and they will tell you, “You folks sent’s to
Bolivar, don’t know where wes goin’ from thar.”
I blistered my feet badly on the march. We hear
that Hollow Springs is evacuated. We have very
stringent orders in regard to stealing. Everything
has to be paid for by the division when it
cannot be traced to the company, regiment or
brigade of the persons committing the theft. I
hope they will be enforced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov. 14.</span> All quiet. We had brigade drill this
forenoon. Our brigade consists of the 7th Missouri,
8th, 63rd and 18th Illinois, commanded by
Col. Stevenson of the 7th Missouri. Our regiment
is the first of the fourth brigade, third division,
of the right wing of Gen. Grant’s army. Gen.
John A. Logan made a speech to the troops this
afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov. 20.</span> Col. Stevenson made a few remarks
to us this morning after drill. He is good natured
and jolly, and a fine speaker. He gave us great
praise and said he had the 7th Missouri, 8th and
63rd Illinois, with the pick of another five or six
regiments, among them ours. He took us and
placed us on the right of his brigade in preference
to any other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov. 21.</span> Our brigade was reviewed by Generals
McPherson and Logan this afternoon. Gen.
McKean’s brigade was reviewed today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov. 24.</span> There was grand review this afternoon.
Generals McPherson, Grant and Logan
were the review officers. The weather is fine but
the nights are very cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov. 25.</span> On picket one mile southeast of
LaGrange, the night was very cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov. 27.</span> We received orders to pack up and
be ready to move down town this morning, where
we were to be quartered and remain as provost
guard. We marched down about 8 o’clock and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
secured our quarters. Sixteen, including Frank
and myself, took a room upstairs in an old
grocery with an old stove. During the day we
fixed our bunks and got some benches from a
church close by, and by night had things quite
comfortable. LaGrange comes nearer to being like
a northern town than any other I have seen in
the South.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov. 28.</span> I was on guard in front of the Provost-marshall’s
office today. The troop began to
move toward Holly Springs long before day light.
While I was in town five batteries and as many
brigades passed. Gen. Grant passed us a number
of times. He is looking a great deal better than
when at Inka.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov. 29.</span> The troops have mostly passed out
and it is getting quiet once more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 1.</span> While I was looking out of the window
this morning at some recruits for the 48th Indiana,
whom should I see but John Metternich of our old
company. (Co. E, 12th Ind.) He was as much
surprised as I; the last time I saw him, his head
was bruised and bleeding as the result of a spree.
This morning a band of guerillas came up within
about two miles of this place, captured a number
of mules and burned the cotton they were hauling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 2.</span> Tuesday. The 109th Ill. came in
tonight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 4.</span> I was on guard today. It rained
nearly all day, and toward night we had a real
northerner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 5.</span> Late in the afternoon it turned cold
and began to freeze and snow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 6.</span> Ground is frozen quite solid this
morning, for the first time this winter. There is
some excitement among the boys of the 17th in
regard to a report that Gov. Yates has ordered
home ten of the old regiments to recruit and fill
up their ranks. If any go, the 17th will probably
be one of them, as the company reports only
twenty-two for duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 7.</span> Sunday. I was detailed for guard this
morning and stood before the provost-marshall’s
office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 9.</span> On fatigue. Weather fine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 10.</span> Weather fine. We had dress parade
at 4 o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 11.</span> Weather warm. I was on fatigue
nearly all day, cutting and hauling wood for the
company. We had dress parade at 4 o’clock. Just
at dusk the news came in that a guerilla band was
to attack us before morning. Fifty men from our
regiment and forty-eight from the 126th (which is
here doing picket duty) were detailed to build
breastworks of cotton, four hundred bales of which
lay near the depot. Col. Norton and Major Bates
did the engineering. After they had finished we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
lay on our arms during the night, but no enemy
made its appearance, and about 7 o’clock we were
ordered back to camp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 12.</span> Quite sore from chopping and rolling
cotton. Our Colonel, Amos Norton, is Commander
of the Post, and Rats is provost-marshal, Col.
Smith commanding the regiment. Toward dark a
rumor was rapidly circulated through the camp
that we were ordered to Holly Springs, Miss. No
one could tell where it started from, and consequently
no one credited it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 13.</span> Marching orders, sure enough. We
drew three days’ rations this morning, with orders
to have two cooked and in our haversacks, ready
to march at 5 o’clock the next morning. I have
a new pair of boots which I expect to break in
on the march—or they will break me. We were
relieved this morning by the 126th. I have a very
severe cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 14.</span> Sunday. Reveille sounded this morning
a little after 2 o’clock. We filled our haversacks,
got our breakfasts, and by daylight were
ready for the march. We fell into ranks, the
regiment was formed, and then we witnessed an
unexpected ceremony which is disgusting to every
true soldier—the drumming out of a fellow soldier
for disobedience and disgraceful conduct. I should
prefer death to being marched between two lines
of a regiment by a guard, at a charged bayonet, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
an escort, the band playing the Rogues March, and
the remainder of the regiment standing at charged
bayonets; but it was soon over, the ranks were
closed, and the regiment started on the march.
We crossed Wolf Creek, a fine stream one mile
from LaGrange. We passed over a fine country
somewhat broken. The army has surely left its
mark here. Miles of fences and scores of houses
have been burnt. From one place we could count
seven or eight ruins. The destruction of property
is not countenanced by a good soldier, but every
regiment has its straggling, order breaking reprobates
that are a disgrace to the flag they fight
under. We reached Coldwater toward night and
camped. I was on guard. I came across an old
cove who helped build dam No. 4, in Maryland,
and knew all the citizens who live there now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 15.</span> We struck tents early, packed our
effects as snugly as possible, and as on the preceding
morning, shouldered our knaps. It rained
during our entire march to Holly Springs, the
flower city of the South, and on our arrival there
the flood gates of heaven opened and the rain
poured down on our defenseless heads in torrents.
We stood it about two hours before the Colonel
could secure quarters. Three-fourths of a mile up
the railroad track we found a very large rebel
arsenal, but were wet to the skin long before we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
reached this shelter. It continued to rain all day
without intermission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 16.</span> We packed up twice to change our
camp today, but the order was countermanded
each time. The arsenal is a very extensive building
and the rebels turned out one hundred small
arms per day. We are preparing it for an extensive
hospital. Quartered here again tonight. I
went up to the depot and while there met old
Captain Backman, of Co. C, 12th Ind. Reg. He is
now sutler in the same regiment, which is located
but a few miles below here doing picket duty on
the railroad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 17.</span> Toward night we received marching
orders and started for Abbyville at dark. We
heard that there was great excitement at Jackson,
as an attack from a detachment of Bragg’s men
was expected. We marched about eight miles from
town and crossed the Yazoo swamp, where we
camped for the night. The next morning we again
packed up and started for Abbyville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 18.</span> We arrived at the Tallahatchie
Bottoms about noon. Bissell’s engineer regiment
is encamped here. It has just finished the railroad
bridge over the river and the cars now pass on to
Oxford in advance. There was a clearing with
two redoubts which we passed before entering the
woody bottoms of the Tallahatchie. The teams
were halted and we slung our knapsacks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
carried them over the marshy bottoms. We had
advanced but a short distance when the formidable
earthworks which the Rebs had erected, loomed up
before our eyes. When we once more struck terra
firma we were halted, unslung our knaps, and when
the teams came up, packed them on the wagons. I
started on and entered the camp of the 12th Ind.
Volunteers. Found the old members of Co. E.
divided among two companies—F and I, both
gotten up at Warsaw. We arrived at Abbyville
in the middle of the forenoon. The country
between LaGrange and Abbyville is rough and
hilly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 19.</span> Jesse Walker and I went out foraging
and succeeded in capturing a shoat. The nigs were
left very destitute and there will be a great deal of
suffering if the government does not feed them.
There is a report that Jackson, Tenn., is threatened
by Bragg; that there is fighting there and our
communications are cut off, at any rate troops are
on the move, being taken back by rail as fast as
possible. There is a great battle being fought this
morning by Burnside’s men. They have already
fought one whole day. Burnie has crossed the
river and holds Fredericksburg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 20.</span> The news came in this morning that
Holly Springs was entered at daylight and captured.
The Rebels took over two hundred thousand
dollars and burned the depot with all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
stores and the arsenal we had fitted up for a hospital.
After dinner we were set to work building
breastworks of cotton, having captured one thousand
bales from the C. S. A. When we first came
here the regiment was scattered along the railroad,
one company in a place extending nearly to
Oxford. Companies G and K were kept here, this
being the headquarters of Regiment 1, Norton
commanding the Post. Two companies below were
sent up, and by night we had a complete breast-work
of cotton bales, regular old hickory style.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 21.</span> The long roll was beaten at 3 o’clock
this morning. The company was formed and we
marched down to our cotton fort where we lay
until daylight, when the other companies marched
to their camps, and we back to ours. Last night
a division of cavalry passed, going north. It was
composed of the 3rd and 4th Ill., 7th Kansas and
3rd Mich. Just before night Generals Ross and
McArthur came into town with their respective
divisions. They are moving back for some cause.
The weather is fine but the nights are very cold.
It is what people call pleasant fall weather in
Michigan. We have had no more snow since the
flurry in September, and the weather never was
more favorable for a winter campaign. The army
is well clothed, having as much clothing as the
soldiers wish to pack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 22.</span> On guard in Frank’s place, he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
gone foraging ten miles below. More troops passed
on their way back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 23.</span> Gen. Grant passed through here this
morning on the train. The division of Denver’s,
(ex-governor of Kansas, for whom Denver City
was named) passed through here today also. The
troops are all coming up further north. The cars
are going north loaded with cotton. I think this
is a cotton expedition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 24.</span> On picket guard today. Got my boots
half soled. Gen. McPherson passed through here,
and Logan’s division is coming up and passing
through. Our old brigade (Col. Stevenson’s) also
passed. A train came in a little after dark and
was loaded with cotton. The country is stripped
of everything and so we are on half rations. All
the hogs and live stock have been killed. The
Negroes are suffering and I think they would welcome
their old masters. There are a great many
leaving, a large carload left today. We have poorer
fare than at any time since we enlisted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 25.</span> <i>Christmas.</i> I came off guard duty
this morning. We drew half rations for four days
and part of that was cornmeal. Our coffee is rye
and in small quantities at that. The boys have
gone out to see if they can find a stray hog or beef
for Christmas dinner. Oh! if I could be at home
today.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<p><i>One o’clock.</i> We just now received marching
orders to be ready tomorrow morning. Frank,
Bill, Buttons and Boggs of our mess, and Ragan
and Doughty of the Peacock mess, fetched in a
whole beef, and a few minutes later Abe, John and
Scott brought in a whole hog. If we live on half
rations it will not be of meat, as we have a hog
and half a beef. It is very warm and pleasant
today, I lay down and took a nap, but the flies
were so troublesome I could hardly sleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 26.</span> Warm and raining. We were astir
early, cooked our breakfasts, filled our haversacks
with meat and what little bread we had, and fell
in about 7 o’clock. It began to rain and we had
gone but a mile or two when we were wet through.
We secured two ox teams, one of six oxen, and one
of four, which hauled our knapsacks. The 12th
Ind. is still camped on the Tallahatchie. Saw
Lieut. E. Webster and Tom Anderson, they are
living on quarter rations. Capt. Williams, now
Colonel of the regiment, was at Holly Springs at
the time it was captured and he was taken for the
third time. We marched to the Yazoo Bottoms
and camped on the opposite side. It rained and
we were completely soaked. The ground was
muddy and I looked around, found a stack of corn,
dug down to the dry stalks, husked out a lot and
made a bed for myself. We are within seven
miles of Holly Springs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 27.</span> Warm and rainy this morning. We
struck out tents, fell in about daylight and
marched through to Holly Springs, where we saw
the effects of the late raid.</p>

<p>A long ambulance train, a large hotel and one
whole block was burned, also the whole of the large
arsenal building which we had prepared and were
using for a hospital, the large depot and all the
supplies that were in it, two or three engines and
a long train of cars. When the magazines exploded
it jarred out nearly all of the window glass in that
part of the town. We camped on the north side
in a beautiful grove. As soon as camp was laid
off we killed one of our oxen which had labored so
faithfully in hauling our knapsacks here, and drew
one more day’s rations to finish out our four days.
The boys have taken the mills into their own hands
and are shelling and grinding corn, what they
should have done long ago, live off the country.
They tell us that we are the first regiment of the
first brigade, sixth division (Gen. Arthur’s) of
Grant’s department. There has been no time to
parole the sick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 28.</span> Sunday. We lay here all day, all is
quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 29.</span> A foraging party went out this morning.
One of our boys killed five hogs and thirteen
chickens, and found two government wagons and
two barrels of molasses that the Rebs had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
out from Holly Springs and hidden. At 3 o’clock
we had orders to move in twenty minutes for
Moscow, a small town ten miles west of LaGrange
on the Memphis and Charleston railroad. We
marched to the opposite side of Coldwater and
camped for the night. Our brigade was in advance
of the division and our regiment in advance of the
brigade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 30.</span> Rained a good deal last night. We
were up early. Our regiment was rear guard to
the wagon train today. It cleared off early and
was quite cool, making a fine day for marching.
We carried our knapsacks as on the previous day,
and marched about eight miles. Fine country
between Coldwater and Moscow, that is for Mississippi.
Most plantations have fine mansions.
There have been but few troops over this road,
consequently cattle and hogs are quite abundant.
Our boys drove in about sixty hogs and most of
them are fine, fat ones. When they came into
camp the boys pitched in, each man for himself,
and our mess got half a hog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 31.</span> Last night was very cold. It snowed
quite hard. The regiment formed this morning
and guns were fired off. We were formed for
muster at 2 o’clock yesterday. Abe left our mess,
also Geo. Scott, both were ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 1, 1863.</span> Thursday. Bright and clear,
warm and pleasant. How well do I remember two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
short years ago today when we took a sleigh ride
and made a regular family visit at Uncle Tim’s.
Since then I have traveled over four thousand
miles, five hundred and eighty of which I marched
with gun on my shoulder; have seen more vice and
drunkenness than I ever supposed existed, yet I
hope I am morally no worse than when surrounded
by kind relatives and friends. An orderly call
beat immediately after reveille this morning at
which time we received orders to cook our rations
and be ready by half past seven. We cooked our
fresh pork and by the appointed time had it in our
haversacks, and our knapsacks strapped on our
backs, ready for the march. We went eight miles
and camped close to a small town called Lafayette,
situated on the Memphis and Charleston R. R.
As soon as we had pitched our tents, Chas. Berry
and myself went out one mile from camp and killed
a hog. We are now the first regiment of the
first brigade, commanded by Brigadier-General
McArthur, of Gen. Hamilton’s corps, of the left
wing of Gen. Grant’s army. We were put in the
rear of the brigade today as a special guard to
keep up the stragglers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 2.</span> Struck out tents early this morning
and marched to Colliersville, a distance of seven
miles from Lafayette and twenty-four from Memphis.
As soon as we had stacked our arms and
broken ranks, John Cumbersworth and I went out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
a mile and a half from camp and got a fine hog.
While we were skinning it our orderly-sergeant,
Sullivan, Jesse Walker and Mike Walsh were
captured not more than a quarter of a mile distant,
by a band of rebel cavalry. Sullivan turned and
ran and several shots were fired after him, which
we heard plainly but we thought it was the boys
shooting hogs. When we got into camp Bob Dew
and Charlie Berry came in with their paroles,
they having been caught by the same company.
Five paroled from Co. K in one day. Five such
days’ work will muster Co. K out of service. The
17th Ill. at present musters about three hundred
and fifty men. On guard tonight; storming fearfully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 3.</span> Quite pleasant during the day, but it
rained heavily all night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 4.</span> We had inspection at 1 o’clock. Col.
Norton’s tent burned today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 5.</span> Monday. I am on guard at the depot
today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 8.</span> Orders are very strict. If caught outside
of the pickets the fine is ten dollars. We get
up at 4 o’clock in the morning and stack our arms.
I am on parole guard today. We expect to move in
a day or two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 11.</span> The regiment was formed at 4 this
morning. In the afternoon we received marching
orders. Our division has been moving up all day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Logan’s division is here. The stockade fort that
the contrabands are at work on near the depot is
almost completed. At 4 o’clock we had dress
parade. Orders were read, fining the absentees
from roll call since the last of December, one
dollar each time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 12.</span> We were called up at half past three
this morning and were on the road inside an hour,
and by sunrise were four miles on the way. We
arrived at Germantown about 10 o’clock. It is a
village. At five minutes before 12 o’clock we
halted for dinner, and started again on our march
at 1 o’clock, our regiment in advance. We reached
the edge of a town at dusk where we learned
that we were selected as guard at the navy yard.
As we passed through the town, the little children
followed us and hurrahed for Jeff Davis. We
moved to the upper end of town and encamped on
land adjoining the navy yard. Col. Norton bought
five cords of wood for us. He made a speech in
which he said Gen. Hamilton ordered McArthur
to send his best disciplined regiment here as guard,
and he wanted us to be strict, orderly, and diligent.
He also said the duty was a kind of secret
service (how so I do not understand). The guerillas
crossed over last night, cut around and burned
a steamer. We are very tired this evening, having
made the heavy march of twenty-six miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 13.</span> We moved into the navy yard this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
morning. Had seven men detailed for guard. I
was one of them. We were put on camp, or chain
guard. I don’t see where the secret service comes
in, for my part. I was down to see the ex-reb
gunboat, “Gen. Bragg,” she was injured at Vicksburg
and is being repaired. There are five or six
mortar boats lying close to shore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 14.</span> I came off guard this morning. It
rained very hard all the latter part of the night.
Another boat load of troops came down last night,
making five or six in all. They are from the
Kansas Valley Division of Fremont’s old forces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 15.</span> About six inches of snow fell last
night and it has snowed all day. The citizens say
it is the heaviest storm they have seen in a number
of years. By night it was about ten inches
deep. The paymaster paid off all but our company
today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 16.</span> We were paid off this morning, after
which there was a general settling up of accounts.
I drew $41.00; $25.00 advance bounty, one month’s
advance pay, and $3.00 premium for re-enlisting.
I expressed $25.00 home. It is very cold this morning,
not more than five or six degrees above zero.
Towards noon the report came that we were to be
relieved. We were almost frozen, having no chance
to fire up and keep warm. These are the dark days
of a soldier’s experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 17.</span> I was on guard supernumerary in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
daytime and stood beyond Wolf Creek at night.
Towards night the sergeant-major came along with
instructions to be ready at 6:30 o’clock in the
morning to go aboard the transports for down the
river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 18.</span> We were up early and had our things
packed at 8 o’clock, fell into ranks and marched
down to the wharf and on board the “Superior,”
a fine river boat. The 11th Ill., 17th Ill., and part
of the 16th Wisconsin regiments are on our boat.
It took all day to load and at night we went up
to the coal yard just above town to coal up. Abe
and I made our bed down on the top of the hurricane
deck. About midnight it began to sleet and
rain, and before morning our blankets were completely
soaked. It was about as disagreeable a
night as I ever spent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 19.</span> Cold, rainy and windy. We lay here
all day coaling up, and suffered with the cold.
Most of the boys kept warm by drinking whisky.
Nearly all have their canteens full. We have
details patrolling the town, picking up the stragglers.
Still rainy and disagreeable. At 1:30 the
boats backed off and started down the river. We
stopped a few minutes at the forts, two or three
miles below the town. There are fifteen boats in
the fleet, among the principal ones are the “Nettie
Dean,” “Silver Moon,” “Minnehaha,” “Platte Valley,”
“Superior,” “Maria Denning,” “Sunnyside,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
“St. Louis,” “Gate City,” “Mary Forsythe,” “City
of Madison,” “Arago,” and “Belle Reora.” Our
regiment lost about fifty men at Memphis, three
from our company. At dark we tied up to the
Arkansas shore. It was dreary and cold but I
went on shore on purpose to put my foot on Arkansas
soil. We set our pickets and stayed all night.
Abe Van Auken and I slept under Jim Mitchell’s
bunk, the same as the night before and slept fine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 21.</span> The boat shoved off at daylight and
started down at 10 o’clock. We arrived at Helena,
a small town, where we stopped about three hours,
and then went on down the river. It is thickly
timbered on both sides most of the way. There
are a few farm houses scattered along. At sundown
we tied up to the Arkansas shore just forty
miles above Napoleon, at the mouth of the Arkansas
river. As soon as we halted the “Silver Moon”
played several tunes on her calliope. I went back
to a little town of Nig quarters just over the levee,
about one-half a mile from the river and tried to
get something to eat, but they had nothing to sell
or give. Everything was eaten up and the levees
were all breaking away and they could not repair
them as the able bodied had run away. Most of
the Whites that are not in the Rebel service have
left. One of our boats was fired on today. We
passed Napoleon about 9 o’clock. At sundown we
tied up at the Mississippi shore, eighty miles above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the mouth of the Yazoo, and opposite the state of
Mississippi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 23.</span> We started at sunrise as on the preceding
morning. The wind blew quite strong,
making it difficult for some of the smaller boats
to keep up. When we were within a few miles of
the Yazoo, the flagship “Platte Valley” halted and
gave us the signal to close up. We closed up in
regular order and about 3 o’clock came in sight of
a fleet of eighty transports and gunboats at the
mouth of the Yazoo. We halted about one mile
above them, and twelve miles from Vicksburg by
water, or eighty by the short cut on the Louisiana
side. The troops here tell us our boys are working
on the Farragut’s canal and are to have it
finished in a few days. We slept in the boat last
night, Abe and I in our old place. The country
for over a hundred miles above here is quite thickly
settled by wealthy planters. On some of the plantations
the Negro quarters form quite a town. The
trees on the shore are covered with a long vine-like
growth called Spanish moss. It is light green in
color, and gives an appearance of being dead and
covered with icycles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 24.</span> Rained all day; slept in the boat last
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 25.</span> Sunday. The regiment was formed
early this morning and we moved back out of the
levee into camp. The river is rising, it is on a level<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
with our camp. It is warm and pleasant, a real
spring day. There was heavy firing this evening
down the river. I saw the “Chillicothe” tonight.
There were four men detailed to go down to the
ditch tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 26.</span> Warm and rainy. More boats went
down last night, one war boat and several transports.
We heard heavy firing this morning, supposed
to be the gunboats. The river is still rising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 28.</span> Bill Boggs and myself secured a pass
this morning early and started down to the canal.
We followed the river bank until we were about
one mile and half from the ditch, when we saw
that we were upon a bayou that ran back up the
river about two miles. We had to turn back,
feeling pretty badly sold as it made us four miles
extra walk. Young poplars were so thick that we
could not see where we were for a while. The
levee is broken in two places. Our division (6th
McArthur) is repairing the upper one, and the
lower division the lower one. The water is running
through here badly. They are planting artillery
behind the levee all along between camp and
the ditch. The levee forms a substantial breast-work.
One mile this side of the ditch we came,
for the first time, within full view of Vicksburg.
The town lies upon the west side of a sloping bluff.
One large church and the courthouse and one
earthworks could be distinguished quite plainly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
The town did not look more than two or three miles
distant, but it is not less than eight. An officer
was looking through a glass, he could see transports
at the wharf, and a crowd collected around
someone who was taking observations. As we
passed the mouth of the Yazoo we could look up
and see three or four gunboats and as many rams,
while on this side lay the “Chillicothe” and three
rams. As I was going down I was hailed by two
cavalry men who had just passed me. On
looking up, whom should I see but Oll and
Dave Hubler, formerly of Co. E, 12th Ind. They
belong to Co. C, 4th Ind. cavalry. They told me
that Geo. Hissung is down here. They are bodyguard
to Gen. Smith. Pat Gallegher and Bill
Humphrey, our old first lieutenant and orderly,
are here. Nearby is the far famed ditch. About
noon we sat down on its banks and took a good
rest. The boys encamped there say the water has
risen one foot today. It is now five feet deep and
has a rapid current. It averages over twenty feet
wide upon the surface. The Mississippi is rising
rapidly. I went down to the lower end of the
ditch, it is one mile and one-eighth in length.
There are heavy details at work throwing up a
levee on the west side of it. We have thirty two-pound
parrots blockading the river. They are
posted behind the levee here. When we arrived
Gen. McClernand was taking observations. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Rebels are throwing up heavy works below the
mouth of the ditch upon the opposite side. It is
about three miles distant. We could see them
moving around, coming up and going away. We
lay there about two hours and watched them. We
could see two heavy earthworks, or forts, and one
line of rifle pits. We went from here up to the
head of the ditch. It starts in an eddy and there
was a tug, “The Ivy,” lying in front to keep out
the driftwood. It is hard to tell if the thing will
prove advantageous. Large details at work, showing
that the generals still have faith in it. We
understand that they have sent for a dredge. There
are encampments all the way between our division
and the ditch. Gen. Steele’s division is below the
mouth of it. We came back to camp a little after
dark, tired and hungry, having traveled during the
day about twenty miles, but were amply repaid.
McClernand is a homely man, apparently about
forty-five years of age, with black whiskers and a
Roman nose. I saw a fine looking general, said to
be Gen. Steele.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 29.</span> This is a beautiful day. I am quite
stiff and sore from the effects of my walk. There
was a detail from the sixth division this morning,
mounted on mules and sent out in the northwestern
direction upon a scout. Corp. Si. Livingston
and Privates Briton and Schultz represented Co.
K, 17th Ill. They went about sixteen miles to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
little town called Richmond, where they found a
detachment of the enemy, but owing to a large
bayou, our boys could not get at them, and had to
leave them in possession of the place. We heard
heavy cannonading this morning. The Rebs had
undertaken to cross with about five hundred head
of cattle, but slipped up on it, and they fell into
our hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 30.</span> I was detailed on fatigue this morning.
The detail from our regiment worked on the
big break in the levee. We did a good day’s work,
and slightly checked the current. The Mississippi
continues to rise. Uncle Ben, Scott and Patterson
returned from their three days’ scout. They had
been up the river after beef and had secured fifty
head. Mail came in last night, Frank received a
letter from Rosalie, dated Jan. 4. Just to think,
they have had no snow yet in the north. Generals
U. S. Grant and Ross have arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan. 31.</span> The first news that greeted us this
morning was marching orders. After breakfast
we drew four days’ rations, two of them cooked,
put them in our haversacks, and were ready to
march aboard the boats. About 2 o’clock the
regiment was formed and we marched aboard the
“Crescent City” and the “Ella,” escorted by a gunboat,
or Ram No. 2. We started in the fore part
of the night. Abe and I found a place on the lower
deck on the top of a wood pile, and it is well we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
did, for it rained nearly all night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 1.</span> Sunday. We went forty miles last
night. This is a rainy day. Fortune seems to be
against us when we float the Mississippi. Our
rations in the bread line since we left Bolivar have
been mostly hard-tack with cornmeal. We occasionally
draw flour. The hard crackers we draw
are better now than they have been before. The
boats have moved very slowly against the current
today. We arrived at Providence the middle of
the afternoon, landed above the town, and went
ashore. Our company and company F surrounded
the town but caught no one. Capt. Wheeler and
three or four of us entered the Post Office and
searched it. We found a few letters and papers.
We broke open the ballot box which was full of
tickets voted for Jeff Davis. Abe and I each got
us a set of chess men. I got a six-inch drafting
rule, also some pamphlets giving the object and
description of the K. G. C., or Knights of the
Golden Circle. Providence, before the war, must
have been a beautiful town, but now it is almost
deserted. A few women and children were standing
in the doors, nearly scared to death. They
scarcely knew what to expect from the long
dreaded Yankees. The Post Office is a large brick
building, in the back part of which was the equipment
of the Sons of Malta. We caught no guerillas.
We threw out our pickets and slept upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
boat, Abe and I upon the hurricane deck, as our
wood pile was burned up. It was quite cool for
this country, one might say cold. We lay in the
boat until the middle of the afternoon. A detail
from the brigade went out mule-back this morning
on a scout. When we heard that guerillas were
out a few miles in the country, our company and
company G were ordered out. Col. Dietzler said
there was no use in going farther as there were
none there, but the boys wanted a little exercise,
so they took us about two miles to a nice plantation,
where we killed a lot of chickens. Gus
Schultz and I caught eight, I caught five and found
some eggs. John Cumbersworth, also of our mess,
got a frying pan which we needed very much. One
of our boys was thrown from a mule. It commenced
raining just as we started back, and before
we arrived at camp we were completely soaked
through. We were called aboard and dropped off
below town where we remained until morning. The
night was very cold and the ground was frozen
quite solid. This morning there was a detail of
nearly half the brigade for fatigue. We were put
to work digging away the levees to let the water
into Lake Providence, which is one mile back from
the river. There was once a channel between the
river and lake in high water, but it is dammed
up. The lake makes connections with Red River
through bayous. Providence is equally divided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
into three parts, they are separated by the old
channel, which forms a common for the town. The
town is a little higher than the channel, but lower
than the levee. The inhabitants are badly scared
and are moving out. It will all be inundated when
we get the levee cut through. The engineers say
there are four feet and six inches of fall between
the surface of the river and the surface of the
ground below the levee. We worked until noon,
and then another relief came on. The regiment
moved down to the boats and camped on the other
side of the levee. We got a large barroom stove
for our tent. This evening there was a detail sent
across the river to a large plantation for Nigs. One
hundred and forty were caught and sent to Vicksburg.
We saw peach trees in bloom today. We met
Gen. McArthur and bodyguard when we were
coming out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 11.</span> Boggs, Buttons and I went over the
river this morning on an old flat log. About 10
o’clock Si Livingston and I had permission to go
out and get some chickens. We crossed over on
the log, baled out an old canoe, and took a ride up
the river two miles and a half, and stopped at a
beautiful plantation. We could buy nothing. We
then struck back for camp, and stopped on the way
at another plantation and got five chickens. The
steamer “Louisiana” came around this morning
with provisions. Two men from company E<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
knocked down an old Negro and robbed him. It
was proven, and Major Peats had them tied up
by the hands, with a card on their backs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 12.</span> The two men were tied all day. We
played ball.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 13.</span> We played ball again today. It
rained last night. Three men of company G were
tied up today for running the pickets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 14.</span> We were ordered back to Providence
this morning. Caught a sheep and brought it
along. The roads are very muddy. We met Gen.
McArthur on the way back. One of our brigade
went on the south side of the lake and the other
on the opposite side. They are clearing the brush
from the bayou that leaves the lake for Tensa and
are stopping up others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 15.</span> Sunday. We had a big thunderstorm
last night. Part of McClernand’s forces came up
on the transports this afternoon. The supposition
is that all are coming up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 16.</span> I was on guard (supernumerary),
all day and was not called out. It was rainy this
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 17.</span> Rain all last night and all day today.
There has been no work done on the ditch since
we came back, on account of the rain. The river
is falling fast. A large wharf boat went down at
noon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 18.</span> Cloudy this morning, though not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
raining. The ground is covered with water and
mud. The old wooden gunboat “Tyler” is lying
here at anchor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 19.</span> Tuesday. Warm and pleasant. Mud
drying up very fast. Work on the ditch was continued
today by four hundred Nigs. We draw
rations for twelve hundred Negroes, wenches, children
and all. The women and children will be
sent into the cotton fields to work. Men are
detailed to oversee them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 20.</span> Wednesday. Beautiful day. We
played ball.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 22.</span> Friday. On guard. Stood picket in
a large cotton field which contains five or six hundred
acres of cotton, unpicked. I went back to
the cane brake and got a fish pole. The guard of
our forage train came in contact with some cavalry
in the vicinity of Old River and routed them.
In the course of the proceedings a Negro teamster
hopped off his horse, drew a revolver and shot a
Reb who had just shot one of our Captains, and
took two prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 23.</span> We were relieved early. The day was
fine. A fleet of ten boats landed here this morning,
having on board Logan’s division. They landed
and marched back about three miles and camped
on the bank of the lake. John A. Logan looks
fine. Colonel Stevenson looks the same as ever.
It is rumored that he is trying to get us back into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
his brigade. A year ago today George and I explored
the caves under the bluff below the dam, and
one year ago tomorrow we left the dam. Played
ball this afternoon. There are about four hundred
Negroes at work on the levee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 24.</span> Played ball this forenoon and in the
afternoon were detailed to extinguish a fire which
destroyed the best part of town. The Post Office,
one of the best buildings, was burned. We had
dress parade at 4 o’clock. Gen. Logan’s address
to his troops was read to us. Grant and McPherson
were both here today. It is rumored that the
“Star of the West” has been captured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 25.</span> Our division was inspected today by
Major Strong, Inspector-General. Ours was the
first regiment inspected. We had a thunder shower
in the afternoon and an awful one last night and
this morning. Our tent leaked like a sieve. The
river is rising very fast. The bank is being leveled
to keep the water out of the canal. We had dress
parade this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 28.</span> We mustered and had regiment
inspection this afternoon. Major Peats of Co. K
complimented the troops quite highly on their
clean guns. The ground is drying off fast. The
river is still rising. There is much sickness, and
about two burials take place every day. The
“Rocket” came up tonight, bringing Gen. McPherson.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
I heard an adjutant-general say that the
Rebs had sunk the “Indianola.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 1.</span> We had company inspection at 12
o’clock and dress parade at 5 o’clock. We then
drew clothing, which was needed very much. I
drew three pair of socks and one pair of trousers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 2.</span> On picket in the cotton field today
until about 3 o’clock, when Capt. Wheeler, officer
of the day, came around and relieved us. They
have the steam tug on the lake bank nearly ready
to launch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 3.</span> We had a short game of ball this
morning, but Buttons got mad and broke it up.
Negroes are coming in very fast. We had dress
parade at 5 o’clock, after which a game of ball.
To close the scene Bill Lowe and Ragan had a
fight. The river has risen over two inches a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 4.</span> We had dress parade at 4 o’clock.
Orders were read for regimental drill of one hour
each forenoon and afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 5.</span> We received the news of the Conscription
Act. It passed both Houses and became
a law. It receives the general approval of the
soldiers. Peats drilled us from 10 to 11 o’clock
this forenoon, and from 2 until 3 o’clock in the
afternoon. We had dress parade at 4 o’clock.
There was an order read from Major Peats awarding
a medal, worth not less than fifty dollars, to
the best drilled in the manual, and the most prompt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
in the discharge of duty. He gives until the 1st of
May. A dredge passed here today. Some of our
boys found four hundred bales of cotton, a large
pile of corn, and about two tons of meat hidden
in cane brake and swamps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 6.</span> Friday. The gunboat “Tyler” came
up last night and is lying here this morning. I
helped make out muster rolls today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 7.</span> We had a heavy rainstorm last
night. I finished making out the muster rolls for
January and February.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 8.</span> Sunday. We had a warm and sultry
day which ended in a thunder and hail storm. We
had dress parade at 4 o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 9.</span> Helped get out the morning report
book in the forenoon. At noon the company formed
and we marched up town and received our pay.
Mine was nineteen dollars. Cold and windy today.
At about 2 o’clock heavy cannonading was heard
on the other side of the river in the direction of
Yazoo City. It was continued until after dark,
and in the night it started again and continued
for some time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 10.</span> Cold, rainy and disagreeable. We
paid old Sampson off and let him go. We still
have our house and cook in it, and are living
very well at present. We draw crackers two-fifths
of the time, and flour the remainder. We use
cistern water altogether. The spirits of the troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
are higher than they have been in six months. If
old Abe would only call back a portion of the first
volunteers they could soon annihilate the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 12.</span> Bright and pleasant. About one
hundred and twenty-five Nigs were set to work this
morning to open the old levee and let the water in.
We were ordered out of our house this morning.
Had dress parade at 4 o’clock. The sentences of
F, Co. A and W, Co. C, were read. The charges
were attempted desertion. The sentence was the
forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and to be
confined in the military prison at Alton, Ill., with
a ball attached to the leg by a chain four feet long,
to serve out the remainder of the time of their
enlistment, and at the end of the three years to
have “D” branded on their right hips, their heads
shaved, and to be drummed out of service. Some
letters were read from the parents of the boys,
counselling them to desert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 13.</span> Clear and pleasant. I made out
the quarterly returns. For some reason they have
suspended work on the cut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 14.</span> Bright and clear. Drill forenoon
and afternoon. Dress parade in the evening, the
same as yesterday. We had a game of baseball in
the evening. I worked all day on the pay rolls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 15.</span> Warm and rainy. I arose before
roll call and took a walk down to the levee. Vegetation
is starting rapidly. Peach trees are just in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
bloom, and some are leaved out. Logan’s division
came down and embarked on transports during
the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 16.</span> The long expected opening in the
levee was made this evening, amid the shouts and
cheers of the two divisions. The water was let
through in two places, each about two feet wide.
The heavy clay banks melted away rapidly. Along
in the night we heard heavy cannonading.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 17.</span> Hot and sultry. I got up at reveille
and went down to see how the cut prospered, and
found the water rushing through, a perfect torrent.
The channel had washed out about one hundred
feet and is still washing. If it does not succeed,
it will not be for want of water. Captain Bush
went through in a yawl this morning. It was a
dangerous experiment, but he came out all right.
In the course of the day some of Co. A went
through with the same result. Some of the boys
disturbed the bricks in one of the vaults in the
cemetery and exposed a cast iron coffin, hermetically
sealed. The lid was moved and the head and
shoulders of a man who had been dead for eighteen
years were visible through the glass. It is a shame
the way this cemetery has been used. The Nigs
are at work putting up a temporary levee between
camp and the ditch, as some of the town is being
overflowed. The 11th Ill. and 14th Wis. of our
division went up the river a few miles and we hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
they had a fight. Logan’s division started up this
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 18.</span> The cut has washed about one
hundred feet since yesterday. The water in the
ditch is rising fast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 19.</span> Thursday. Cloudy, looks like rain.
Cleaning up and ditching our camp was the order
of the day. I was on the detail to dig a ditch on
each side of the camp. The banks of the ditch are
slowly washing back. It is now about one hundred
and fifty feet at the first levee, and two hundred
at the second. Water is slowly rising in both the
ditch and the lake. The President has given
deserters until April to report at a certain depot.
Co. K expects about four back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 20.</span> Friday. I was up at reveille as
usual and went down to the ditch. To my surprise
I saw a big oak just outside the channel washed
up by the roots. The tree was about three feet in
diameter. Another of nearly the same size washed
out before noon. I went fishing this morning. We
can see fish weighing from forty to one hundred
pounds, working up against the current. I threw
my spear at them, but they were too far off. I
saw a laughable incident this evening in front of
McPherson’s headquarters. Some of the boys were
trying to fasten a yawl to a tree and float down to
where the fish were showing themselves in an eddy.
The first time they missed the tree and went whirling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
into the center of the channel and came very
near upsetting. They finally brought it to, and
after a good deal of hard work, got it into position
for another trial. This time they were successful,
caught a projecting limb and pulled themselves
into the eddy formed by rushing around the tree.
After they had made themselves fast by a long
rope, they undertook to get out of the eddy, which
proved no easy job, for as soon as one end was
pushed into the current the boat would whirl
around and back up into its former position.
While on the whirl it threw off one man’s hat.
McPherson and officers and nearly the whole regiment
were out watching them, and the cheering
was loud enough to raise the dead. It was nearly
dark when they got out of their predicament. I
worked nearly all day on the company’s papers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 21.</span> The water rose in the canal so that
it ran up into our camp in the night. It washed
away the trees that were rooted up yesterday. The
channel is smooth and a good boat could go through
it. One year ago today we left Winchester, Virginia,
on our march for Manasses Junction. Part
of Providence was burned this afternoon. The few
citizens and Negroes whom the raise of the water
had overtaken, were wading in the streets, waist
deep, trying to save what things they had left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 22.</span> We had orders to draw and cook
one day’s rations early this morning. The water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
rose a good deal last night, and nothing but a
small temporary levee keeps the camp from being
inundated, and that is being washed away. The
cattle and mules are all being driven higher up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 23.</span> It rained all night. Our tent leaked
like a sieve. We still remain in camp but it has
rained nearly all day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 24.</span> We had a hard storm last night,
with heavy thunder. This afternoon some miserable
fellows set fire to some buildings, among them
a church. Such men should be sent to Alton. The
channel is deepening and widening, and the water
is rising. It is now about two feet above our camp.
I expect some dark night to be wading out to our
transports, and that right suddenly. The news
came last night that a number of Farragut’s fleet
were at the mouth of the ditch, below Vicksburg,
and that he had taken Warrentown with all its
ordinance. Gen. Carr’s division went down on
transports today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 27.</span> Yesterday and today Buck and I
were at work copying orders into the company
order book. Today they discovered, in Logan’s
division, a girl who had served eighteen months as
a private soldier. They took her to the preacher’s
to get her a dress and will send her north. A good
many of our boys saw her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 28.</span> Two large gunboats, both iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
clads, went up early this morning. Troops are
passing down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 29.</span> We had a lively time last night.
A storm of rain and wind began about 10 o’clock
in the evening and kept up until about 12, when
the wind increased and the rain ceased. Out tent
bent and reeled like a willow. I got up to dress
before she went over, but had just got my legs into
my trousers when down she came full tilt. I finally
extricated myself, seized my knapsack and started
for dry ground, got into the commissary and spread
down, when to cap the climax the levee broke
through and the water came rushing in upon us.
The drums beat, the boys fell in, and we had a
general move up the levee. Most all of the tents
blew down and some of them were whipped nearly
to pieces. In the meantime Captain Bush had his
Negro brigade out, filled them up with whisky, and
ordered them into the water waist deep. By dint
of perseverance and hard work they succeeded in
stopping the break. I took up some boards and
passed the remainder of the night beside the cotton
pile. This morning the effects of the storm were
everywhere present. One of the boats was blown
up on the beach, the smoke stacks of two others
were blown away, and shanties everywhere were
blown down and torn to pieces. It continued cold
and windy all day. Charlie Berry came back last
night. This afternoon Gen. Smith’s (John E.)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
division came down and anchored here for the
night. In the afternoon some of the boys of the
14th made a break on the sutler’s stock. It was
no more than done when the 17th and 95th Ill., 1st
Kan., and 16th Wis. came rolling over the levee.
Canned fruit, boxes of boots, shoes, oysters,
oranges, lemons, bales of shirts, pants, socks,
drawers, barrels of soda crackers and sugar, boxes
of raisins, and in fact everything which the large
stock could contain. He had just got in a new
assignment, valued at somewhere near $10,000.
The poor old fellow ran around wringing his hands
and wishing he had stayed in “Chicago.” The guard
arrived just as they had him completely cleaned
out. I can say that my hands are clear of such
wholesale robbery. At 9 o’clock roll call the companies
had orders to deliver up the contraband
articles in their possession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 30.</span> Monday. Cold. The boys have
turned over most of the stolen goods. Gen Smith’s
division started on its way down this afternoon.
Gen. Grant is concentrating troops rapidly, the
grand issue must be approaching, and the sooner
the better. This afternoon we drew the old fashioned
wedge tents, one for every four men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 31.</span> Tuesday. Frank, Newt, Jim
Sweeny and I comprise our newly established household,
and we were busy until afternoon raising and
settling our tent, and building our bunks. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
went out foraging last night and made a raise of
boards enough to put up our tent, build our bunks,
etc. This afternoon the little tug came out of the
lake into the river. We are having very cold
weather for the place and time of the year. We
hear that Gen. McArthur has acquitted the 17th
Ill. of the raid. One year ago tonight the 12th Ind.
was camped at Bristo Station, and I made my
unsuccessful search for Uncle Lebbeus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 1.</span> Wednesday. Last night was cold and
frosty. A boat came in with a load of deserters.
There were quite a number for the 17th, but none
for company K. About the middle of the forenoon
a steamer passed up, towing an iron clad. She
must have been disabled at Yazoo or at Vicksburg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 2.</span> At 11 o’clock last night an orderly
call sounded and we received the orders to cook
two days’ rations, and be ready at 7 o’clock, to
board the transport for a foraging expedition. The
morning was cool and pleasant. At the appointed
time we boarded the steamer “David Tatum” and
proceeded slowly up the river. On the way we saw
where the levee had been cut in a number of places,
the water was rushing through rapidly. All the
country back was flooded. We stopped and took a
couple of Negroes and a fine yawl. We arrived at
our destination about 4 P. M. It was sixty-five
miles above Providence Lake. The object was to
secure a barge of hay which had been wrecked and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
partly sunk the night of the storm. There were
six companies of us, and we were divided into
reliefs of two companies each, and set to loading
the hay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 3.</span> We succeeded in getting the boat
loaded by 3 P. M., then we started down and
landed fifteen miles below and killed a lot of hogs
and took a large, beautiful, ten oared boat. It was
the nicest thing of the kind I had ever seen. Frank
and Doty took some books and got themselves into
trouble. We backed off and started down about
dusk. Peats had four or five men tied up. We met
a fleet of thirteen boats just after starting. After
dark there was a light waved on shore as a signal
to come to, but the Captain thought it might be a
decoy so we steered on down and arrived at our
camp about 11 o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 4.</span> The paymaster is here and we sign
the pay rolls this afternoon for four months’ pay.
Hospital boats are going below and there is every
indication of an approaching engagement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 5.</span> Was detailed and worked all afternoon
unloading commissaries from the “Woodsides”
to the “City of Madison,” a commissary
boat of the post. A gunboat went down the river
this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 6.</span> Monday. Today is a great day for
the 17th, as it is the anniversary of the battle of
Shiloh. We moved back to the cotton field this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
morning, it being much higher and a better camping
ground. It took most of the day to move, raise
our tents and settle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 7.</span> Tuesday. A general clearing up of
camps which took until this afternoon. Tom Martin
came back yesterday and an order was read at
dress parade returning him to duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 8.</span> Wednesday. At 11 o’clock this forenoon
an orderly call was beaten and we received
orders to be ready in fifteen minutes with all our
arms and all our accoutrements on, to march down
with other brigades of the division, to a large plantation
house. Upon the porch stood Generals
Thomas, McPherson, McArthur, Crocker, and a
drove of the “rankest commish,” such as Colonels,
Lieut. Cols., and Majors. Gen. Thomas was a fine
stately looking man, tall, with iron gray hair, and
apparently about sixty-five years of age. He was
introduced by Gen. McPherson in a pleasant
speech. Gen. Thomas then made a few remarks in
which he expressed great sympathy for the poor
enslaved Africans, and announced the President’s
settled policy of arming the Negroes. He authorized
two regiments to be raised here. He said he
had authority to commission officers for said regiments,
where the applicants came well recommended.
I like the policy. He also said the object
of it was to protect the navigation of the Mississippi
and defend other Negroes who were at work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
on abandoned plantations trying to raise their
living. After Gen. Thomas was through, Gen.
McArthur was called on. He came forward and
gave a short, good natured speech. He was heartily
cheered. After him came Col. Reed of the 15th
Iowa, Crocker, and Captain Chink, who by the
way, is to be Colonel of one of the regiments.
When they had concluded we marched back to
camp and Gen. Thomas boarded the steamer
“Rocket” and started up to Logan’s division. When
we returned six applications had been handed in
for appointments in the regiments of color—from
Co. K, namely: Hines, Davis, Foxears, Foster,
Chesher and Berry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 9.</span> Warm and pleasant, in fact we have
had beautiful weather for over two weeks. Major
Peats is gone and Capt. Moore is in command of
the regiment. Nearly half the company went fishing
this afternoon. Buck got a pass to take us
outside the pickets and we caught about a mess.
We had dress parade at 5:30 P. M. Two boats, the
“Edward Walsh” and the “City of Alton” came
down with deserters. There were two for our
company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 10.</span> Warm and pleasant. At 10 o’clock
we had muster. The whole U. S. forces are to be
mustered today, to find the exact condition of the
army, and the number of conscripts needed to fill
the regiments up to the required standard. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
had dress parade this evening in which the two
deserters were returned to their companies by a
regimental order. Our company needs about fifty-four
to fill it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 11.</span> Saturday. A beautiful day. On
regimental guard. Most of the company have gone
fishing. We have as easy and fine times now as
it is possible for soldiers to have. Foster got the
position of Captain in the new regiment. They
had a Negro meeting this afternoon. Chink, and
a colored man named Frederick Douglas, spoke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 12.</span> We had a hard rain last night. Our
new tents did not stand the storm much better
than the old ones. They disappointed us much.
Captain Wheeler succeeded in getting B——
an appointment in the 9th La., Chink’s regiment.
Some of the boys are quite hurt to think as poor
a soldier as he should have the appointment. They
went down below on the “Platte Valley” and
brought up a large number of Negro recruits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 13.</span> Rainy and disagreeable. Ross’s
division passed below today. They did not land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 14.</span> Cool and cloudy. I was detailed
and went down the river foraging. It was about
six miles and the roads were very muddy. About
5 o’clock, Hornby’s division came down direct from
Yazoo Pass. The “Lady of Jackson,” the “Duke
of Argyle” and other stern wheelers were nearly
ruined in that expedition. They were the nicest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
boats on the river when they left here a month ago.
The 48th Ind. was aboard. I hunted up John
Metternich and had a long talk with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 15.</span> Wednesday. Went down and visited
with John this morning, until the fleet backed off
and started down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 16.</span> Gen. McClernand and staff went
below today. More troops passed down the river.
Some of the troops broke into a sutler’s shop night
before last, and there is an investigation going on,
so we are not to get our pay until it is settled.
Capt. Moore spoke to the regiment tonight on dress
parade and offered one hundred dollars to the man
furnishing the most evidence of the guilty parties.
We have review of the division tomorrow, and
brushes and blacking are in great demand tonight
The Captain buys it with the company fund and
furnishes it to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 17.</span> Our brigade was formed at 8:30
A. M. and we marched down about three miles,
where we found the other brigades drawn up en
mass awaiting us. We were reviewed by McArthur
and everything passed off in style. I think we
never did better. We returned to camp about 2
o’clock. Capt. Moore (commanding the regiment)
told us he would leave a paper with the Captains
of the different companies, for those not implicated
in the sutler raid to sign. The Negro regiments
are filling up fast. Today I saw one on guard for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
the first time. There was heavy cannonading for
about four hours last night, and occasionally today.
It is supposed the fleet is trying to run the blockade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 18.</span> Saturday. Warm and pleasant. Our
brigade is ordered down the river for review. It
was supposed to be done for Gov. Yates, but he did
not arrive, and McArthur took us through, the
same as the day before. I think we did slightly
better than we did the other time. A little after
dark we had an awful storm of wind and rain. I
got up and dressed, thought surely the tent was
going over, but it was all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 19.</span> Sunday. We got four months’ pay
today—no pay was deducted. I expressed home
$55 and Frank sent $45.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 23.</span> Thursday. On picket at the Negro
quarters of the 8th La. Leavitt volunteered to
stand my guard. We got orders this evening to
prepare three days’ rations for a foraging expedition
up the river. Capt. Wheeler went home today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 24.</span> Friday. We boarded the “White
Cloud” this morning and started up to Greenville,
where we arrived in the afternoon. A regiment
had just boarded transports and started below.
We lay there until after dark, then started and
landed toward morning, about seventy-five miles
above Greenville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 25.</span> Buck took Fox, Boggs and I outside
the pickets and we went up about two miles to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
fine plantation where we got a lot of butter, a
knife, some forks, a chicken, and all the sweet milk
we could drink. We found the overseer’s account
book hidden in an old chicken coop with some
other things. At night the chickens, goats, sheep
and hogs came in by wholesale, together with a lot
of beeves. The object of our expedition was to
obtain Negroes and supplies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 26.</span> Sunday. Twenty-one years old today.
How my mind carries me back to those good old
times when I used to welcome this day of all others,
when my sister, aunts, and grandpa composed the
family circle. What a change! That good old
man whose memory I revere and cherish, is gone,
and the old place is sold. On picket today. Mosquitoes
are very thick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 27.</span> It rained this forenoon. We started
back about 1 o’clock and arrived at Lake Providence.
Found orders there awaiting us, to leave
in the morning for Vicksburg. I took a good wash
and went to bed. The river is rising very fast.
The Captain commanding the expedition did not
want us to take off our live stock, but the boys
threw them overboard and secured them as they
swam ashore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 29.</span> Wednesday. Making out muster
rolls today. We had dress parade at 5 o’clock.
The “Edward Walsh” came up this morning for
the 95th and us. We are to return to Stevenson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
brigade. Stevenson is now Brigadier-General. We
expect warm work shortly. The river is falling
rapidly. It is a number of feet below where it was
in the spring when we first came down here. I
was walking on the bank this evening when whom
should I see but Coon, the little Negro who used
to cook for Capt. Williamson. A new iron clad
boat and hospital boat went down the river yesterday.
I wrote two letters today, one to Rosalie,
and one to George Butterfield.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April 30.</span> Thursday. Major Peats returned
last evening and at 8 o’clock this morning, mustered
us for pay, after which we boarded the
steamer “Edward Walsh” for Milliken’s Bend.
Most of the boys bought what was called blackberry
jam, but it was merely liquor in cans and
created a drunken row in which some were hurt,
one officer and two privates. Arrived at the Bend
before dark. The troops have all left, except the
convalescents. They took one tent to each company
and loaded the train with commissaries, hard-tack,
pork, coffee, salt and sugar. I took a towel,
one pair of socks, my oilcloth and blanket. This
evening we heard heavy and continued firing up
the Yazoo, supposed to be Sherman attacking
Hams Bluffs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 1.</span> Friday. Up at 4, and started on our
march at daylight, accompanied by the 95th and
a big train of commissaries. A fine road has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
made by Bush’s engineering corps. We passed
through Richmond, a small country town. It is a
beautiful country and the planters are wealthy.
The plantations range from six hundred to twenty-four
hundred acres. The land is low and level and
the soil is rich. The roads have been very bad, but
are better now. We made a hard march of nineteen
miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 2.</span> Marched fifteen miles, very tired. We
passed McArthur’s division this forenoon. Weather
awfully hot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 3.</span> Started at 5 o’clock, as usual. The
country through which we are now passing is the
most beautiful I have ever seen. The plantation
mansions are grand, and the grounds and outbuildings
are fitted up in fine style. Each plantation
has a splendid steam gin, and some have steam
cane-mills as well. The mills must have cost
between ten and twenty, possibly thirty thousand
dollars. The inhabitants have but recently left.
They put in their corn crops, and some cotton,
before going. The corn is nearly two feet in height.
The boys have destroyed a number of gins and a
good deal of furniture. The roads have mostly
followed the banks of bayous, and alligators, turtles
and snakes abound. The boys have shot a
number of alligators. We marched twenty miles
today. I became overheated and completely
exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 4.</span> We started early and after marching
eight miles, arrived at the landing called “Hard
Times,” where we took the steamer “Silver Wave.”
We crossed the river and landed four miles below
at Grand Gulf. There is a high promontory and a
range of bluffs here which the Rebels had forfeited
with nine guns. It commanded the entrance to
the Black River as well as the Mississippi. It was
a fort of nature’s own construction. We have had
a fatiguing march and a good many have given
out. Grant’s headquarters are eighteen miles back.
We hear that Logan’s division is in advance and
has done good fighting, also that many prisoners
have been taken. I should like to hear from home
very much just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 5.</span> Gov. Yates and Adjt. Gen. Thomas are
here. We are detailed to remain here and do
fatigue duty. The burning barges loaded with
provisions came down this evening. The town of
Grand Gulf is entirely destroyed. I didn’t know
there had been a town there until told.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 6.</span> We hear that McClernand’s troops are
advancing. One hundred and twenty-eight prisoners
came in this morning. We are having a very
cold snap for this time of the year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 7.</span> Thursday. Very cold again today.
Had to stand around the fire to keep warm. Seventy-four
more prisoners came in today. A good
many of our boys found old friends or acquaintances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
among them. They have been very poorly
dressed and fed. There is general activity today,
Steele’s division is crossing over—also Tuttle’s.
Gunboats and transports are engaged in the work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 8.</span> Friday. All quiet. Sherman’s corps
moved out this morning. An exorbitant price is
demanded for everything. A sheet of paper and
envelope are five cents each. Twenty-five cents for
a lemon; six dollars for a canteen of whisky; milk
costs a dollar a quart, and other things in proportion.
At 5 o’clock we boarded the “Empire City”
for the lower landing, fifteen miles below, to protect
the hospital and bring off the wounded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 9.</span> Saturday. We disembarked early this
morning and went back in the country three miles
where we found about three hundred of our
wounded in a splendid country mansion. The
books show that the house cost over one hundred
thousand dollars. We lay here in the shade during
the day while the ambulances were carrying the
wounded down to the river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 10.</span> Sunday. We were awakened last
night at 11 o’clock and ordered to fall in with all
possible speed. We hurried back to the river and
returned to Grand Gulf, which was supposed to
be in danger of an attack. Flats and transports
brought down shipping teams which sent food to
the front. Cumbersworth, Hagan and Hunt each
got a barrel of flour last night when they were on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
extra duty, burying a soldier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 11.</span> Monday. Made out muster rolls this
forenoon. Blair’s division came down this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 12.</span> Tuesday. On brigade guard. Jim
Chester and I went outside the pickets and picked
dewberries and mulberries, all we could eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 13.</span> Wednesday. I made a raise on commissary
last night. Boggs, Schultz and I ran the
pickets and got some mulberries this morning, and
brought back four quarts of which we made pies
this afternoon. McArthur’s division is coming in.
Hooker is fighting a great battle in the East. We
cannot get the particulars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 14.</span> Thursday. We got orders this morning
to be ready to move at a moment’s notice. We
hear that Grant has had another battle. The “Gen.
Price” came up this morning from Red River. We
were ordered on the march at 8 o’clock. It rained
just enough to lay the dust and make good marching.
We marched ten miles and camped on a small
stream. The country is rough and hilly. The
roads follow the ranges of hills, so there are few
to climb. Every patch of ground that is tillable is
tilled and planted to corn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 15.</span> Friday. Marched twenty miles, saw
some fine fields of wheat that are just turning. We
heard the cheering news today that Richmond, the
Rebel capital, is captured, and also that Jackson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Miss., is taken. The country is the same as yesterday—rough
and hilly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 16.</span> Saturday. We had a hard march of
twenty-five miles today. We passed through Utica
and camped at Raymond. We heard cannonading
in the direction of Big Black Bridge. A battle is
supposed to be taking place. The hills have gradually
disappeared and the face of the country is
quite smooth. I saw wheat nearly ready for the
reaper. The boys are tired tonight. I keep up
fine. We passed a number of hospitals filled with
the wounded and also passed a large number of
prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 17.</span> Sunday. We started for Big Black
Bridge early. Nine miles out we came upon the
road leading from Jackson to Vicksburg, and were
upon the battle ground of yesterday. The horrors
of war were everywhere visible. The dead and
wounded were scattered around over the ground.
Here we came upon Bill Stafford, who said
McPherson’s corps took seventeen hundred prisoners
and thirteen pieces of artillery, but were badly
cut up. They are burying the dead. It is rumored
that Pemberton was killed. In one place the horses
of nearly a whole battery were killed. We marched
five miles, joined our old brigade, and camped on
Black River. Our advance has reached the bridge,
and taken three thousand prisoners, and seventeen
cannon. McPherson says we have taken seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
thousand prisoners and sixty-eight pieces of light
artillery since crossing the Mississippi. We saw
Stevenson and Logan this afternoon. I saw
Quimby when we stopped for dinner. A number of
fellows swam the Black River and captured chickens,
pigs, etc. The Rebels have chosen their own
ground and have been badly whipped each time.
We draw <i>scarcely any rations</i>. Engineers are
bridging the river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 18.</span> Monday. We lay in camp until 1
o’clock, when the bridge was completed and orders
came to advance. We crossed in the rear of Blair’s
division and marched to within six miles of Vicksburg.
The country is nothing but a succession of
hills. Sherman’s corps was in the advance. The
roads were very dusty, but we marched six miles
before we bivouaced for the night, tired, hungry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 19.</span> Tuesday. Arose early and advanced
three miles and formed our line of battle, our
brigade on the left of Smith’s. We held this line
until afternoon. On the right they fought a little,
some balls passing over our heads. About 1 o’clock
we moved up and formed a line. Shells passed
over our heads, one man in our regiment was
wounded and three horses killed. By this time our
batteries were planted and the cannonading became
general. It lasted until 3 o’clock and then slackened
and we moved to the right about half a mile.
McPherson, Logan and Stevenson are in the thickest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
of it. We hear that Sherman’s right rests on
the Mississippi, and McClernand’s left, below. If
so they have them completely surrounded. All
praise to Gen. Grant. The country is rough and
hilly, and the hills steep and rugged, and run in
ranges parallel around the town. At 1 o’clock we
moved still further to the left and a little forward.
Wounded men are being brought in rapidly. We
lay here till morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 20.</span> Wednesday. We were astir early and
took breakfast. Cannonading began at daylight.
We were ordered back to our brigade and moved
up to the road. Shells were thrown over, so we
moved to the right and were drawn up. Here we
were protected by a hill, and awaited orders. We
were soon ordered to the left, and advanced about
half a mile or more, and lay under the brow of a
hill which protected us from the enemy’s fire. Their
line of works are but forty rods in advance.</p>

<p>10 o’clock—Batteries on our right have opened
and there is a regular artillery duel going on over
our heads. There is an occasional premature burst,
one of which seriously wounded Dare. Doty and
Shaw each got a slight rap. Our line of skirmishes
are on the hill above. I went up and skirmished a
while and fired fifty-nine rounds. While there,
word was brought me that Frank was slightly
wounded. The ball hit a pocket, which was full of
things, broke a looking glass, the handle of a toothbrush,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
and a thick letter from Cousin Sarah. It
merely broke the skin, making a bruise. He had
not fired a single shot. Seven of our regiment were
wounded today. We lay here all night. A singular
incident happened during the night. We struck up
a conversation with the Rebels. One of our boys,
after talking a long time, found he was talking
with an old friend. Inquiries were made for
mutual acquaintances, and they had a real social
time. Finally they laid down their arms and came
together. The line of fire that followed the shell
from our gunboats and mortars sent over that ill-fated
town was a grand sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 21.</span> Thursday. At daylight the implements
of death and destruction were opened once
more. I saw some splendid work done by our
artillery and there were many little incidents
worthy of note. Three shots came very near hitting
me, one went between Doty’s head and mine, which
were about a foot apart. Brisk fighting all day.
Bill Stafford came here and I wrote a few lines
home and sent them by him to mail. At dark the
firing ceased and a lively chat was again opened
by the contending parties. It looked singular to
see men fighting with deadly aim during the day,
and then spending the night in friendly conversation.
I slept in the same hollow. Gunboats and
mortars fired at regular intervals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 22.</span> Our line of skirmishes opened at daylight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
as usual. 7 o’clock—Scaling ladders are
being brought around. 10 o’clock—Deployed for
the charge. Terrific cannonading going on over our
heads. Shells are prematurely bursting, wounding
our own men. Night—The day has finally passed
away. The 81st Ill. and the 7th Mo. made the
charge and were repulsed. Charging was done
along the whole of the lines, but it was not a concerted
movement and proved a total failure, owing
probably to the nature of the grounds. Our boys
charged up to the works in splendid style but were
not supported. The Confederates raised and poured
deadly volumes among them and swept their ranks
with grape. We left a good many killed and
wounded upon the field. Among the officers, the
Colonel of the 81st was killed and Humphries of
the 95th. Our regiment made no charge, but
advanced close to the works and acted as sharpshooters,
and when our charging column was
repulsed, we were ordered to retreat. J. R., fool-like,
gave the order loud and distinct, and as we
fell back they poured the musketry and grape
among us. We finally returned to the old camp,
having lost eighteen, killed and wounded. The
Rebel works extend as far as the eye can see. They
are a succession of forts and rifle pits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 23.</span> Saturday. Rainy. How I wish I had
a clean shirt or time to wash this! We were up in
good time and moved toward the scene of action.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
We again acted as skirmishers. No charges were
made today. We lost two men. As soon as it was
dark, Sweeny, Chester and myself dug a fort on
the brow of the hill, and also a line of retreat.
While we were at work the Rebels struck up a
conversation. They were lively and sociable. They
wanted to meet us half way and have a sensible
chat. They appeared quite confident of holding the
place. They made a great many inquiries after old
friends and acquaintances. They are tired of war,
generally and said they wish old Abe and Jeff Davis
had to fight it out. They said they would give anything
for a little coffee. The conversation became
too general and our batteries opened and put a
quietus on it by sending over a few quiet reminders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 24.</span> Sunday. Up early and took our position
behind the works. I had fired but one shot
when we were relieved by the 80th Ill., and returned
to camp for a day’s rest. Toward noon
Grant issued an order for each man to wash and
clean up. The order was quickly and gladly obeyed.
Captain Wheeler’s company returned today. Bill
was here but a short time when he was wounded.
Two of our men were wounded. The rumor is
afloat that Joe Johnston is coming up in our rear.
It had the effect of closing up a lot of miserable
stragglers. We have a line of rifle pits dug within
five or six rods of the Rebel works, running parallel,
from which the 20th Ill. is trying to undermine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the main fort. The Rebels are no doubt
suspicious of their intentions, for they began to
rain down grenades upon them. About this time
a sad accident happened. One of the thirty-two
pound parrots threw a shell among the 20th, which
took off the legs and an arm for one poor fellow,
a leg and an arm for another, killed two, and
wounded several others. This double attack was
too much for them and they fell back. This encouraged
the Rebels and they rose and poured a heavy
and continued fire upon us, which was finally
silenced by our sharpshooters and artillery. Lavonan’s
division has been sent back to take care of
the rear. We are confident of success. I stood
one hour picket tonight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 25.</span> Monday. A good deal of firing and
some cannonading up to 3 o’clock, when a flag of
truce came out. I was over the hills after plums
at the time. There was a cessation of firing along
the whole line. Dispatches were sent to Gen. Grant.
Logan went down to the Hollow where he met the
Rebel Colonel Montgomery, a major and a number
of other officers. Hostilities were suspended till 8
o’clock and we went over and buried our dead of
the day of the charge. They had lain three days
in the sun and had turned black. Firing had no
sooner ceased along the line than the contending
parties mingled like a flock of sheep. A great
many found friends and relatives, and two or three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
found brothers. The Rebels were very anxious to
exchange for coffee. They are, taken altogether,
the finest looking lot of Confeds I have seen. We
mingled to such an extent that their officers
ordered them back, I think that they were afraid
to trust them, for a good many did desert. When
they turned back they bade us good-bye and said
it was hard to open hostilities again. Frank is
around. I got a letter from home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 26.</span> Tuesday. Very little artillery firing
this forenoon. I went down to Cook’s quarters,
got some paper for Buck, and wrote home. They
are connecting headquarters with telegraph wires.
One man was wounded this afternoon. One brigade
from each division is moving back to the rear.
They moved about 11 o’clock at night, under the
command of Gen. Frank Blair. Heavy details are
at work entrenching.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 27.</span> Wednesday. Moved back to the next
hollow in the night. This morning Brophy was
wounded. The day was mostly spent in fixing up
cane brake shanties or shades. Toward night,
Wood of Co. A was killed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 28.</span> Thursday. We were ordered sharpshooting
this morning. Nothing extraordinary
happened. Dick Stephens was killed this afternoon—shot
through the head. I was on guard last
night. They threw three or four shells over us.
Were busy all the fore part of the night issuing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
rations, and bringing water from the river. Col.
Smith came back today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 29.</span> Friday. We were relieved and returned
to camp early this morning. Jim Chesher
was wounded. The ball passed through our shanty
and over me. Our artillery along the whole line
opened this morning and it was a grand sight. The
Rebels dare not reply. They did not show a piece.
We fired one hour this morning and one this evening—giving
them their daily rations, also opened
in the night pouring hundreds of shot and shell
among them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 31.</span> Sunday. Today ends one month of
active campaign, which has so far been successful,
and I do not see why it should not end more
brilliantly than it has begun. I hope to Heaven it
will. Bill Stafford brought over the news this
morning that Joe Johnston is fortifying Jackson.
Our knaps came in from Young’s Point today all
right. The weather is hot and sultry. Some artillery
firing. I went upon the hill this evening to
see the mortars shell the town. The sight is beautiful,
but it is sad to think of those deadly missiles
so faithfully doing their work of destruction. Many
a family tie has no doubt been severed. We hear
that a great many women and children have been
killed. Surely the instigators of war ought to
suffer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 1.</span> Monday. A terrific cannonading was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
opened and kept up a long time from our line last
night. I think it must have awakened some of the
Rebels from their slumbers. Rumors are afloat this
morning that the Confeds tried to cut their way
through but were driven back. We had inspection
of arms this morning, by Reynolds, at 10 o’clock.
The artillery are getting a heavy supply of ammunition
ready at their batteries and are preparing
for operations. The weather is hot. We have a
well dug in the quarters, which furnishes good
water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 2.</span> The mortar boats were unusually
active last night, and part of the town was burned.
It made a grand illumination. Towards morning
infantry firing opened, also artillery. We were
immediately formed for action, not knowing what
was coming, but we thought it was the Rebs. It
finally died down and we lay ready to fall in at
a moment’s notice, but were not disturbed until
morning. We were up before the sun, preparing
to be out sharpshooting. Our artillery opened the
middle of the afternoon and poured a perfect torrent
of shot and shell over us. A good many burst
among us. One man was wounded and we thought
ourselves very lucky that no more were hurt. At
night our boys tried to strike up a confab with
the enemy, but not a word could be drawn from
them. They were as silent as their works.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 3.</span> Wednesday. We were relieved early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
and returned to camp. Quiet during the day.
Siege guns are coming up and heavy details are at
work, entrenching and fortifying. About 8 o’clock,
just as I had gone to bed and gotten to sleep, after
a good wash, we were awakened by the boom of
musketry, and ordered to form our line of battle
immediately. We did so. Co. K and one or two
others were held in reserve while the others were
at work digging rifle pits. The firing gradually
died away as it did the night before, and we lay
down at 2 o’clock in the morning, dressed and
equipped so as to be ready to fall in at a moment’s
warning. It was rumored that the Rebs were making
a desperate effort to cut their way through the
net Grant completely enclosed them in, but the
rumor proved false.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 4.</span> Thursday. All quiet. Heavy details
were made to work on fortifications. One detail
was at work digging a magazine which caved in
and killed one man and wounded another from our
regiment. I was on the detail that worked on the
big fork of the road. I worked for over an hour in
plain view of the Rebel sharpshooters on the right.
They were not more than one hundred and fifty or
two hundred yards distant. I expected a ball every
minute, but for some reason they didn’t fire until
our relief came on and then they sent a volley over.
The work we are constructing here is on an eminence
not more than twenty rods from the main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Rebel fort. From here one can see the river, town,
and a large hospital camp, also three lines of works,
mostly rifle pits. We have heard that the fire in
town the other night was their commissary depot
and that the citizens set it on fire to end their
sufferings, which were beyond their power of
patriotism and fortitude to endure. It is rumored
that they first requested Pemberton to cut out or
surrender. The Rebels called over the line the
other night for us to look out as they had a new
General. We asked who it was and they replied:
“General Starvation.” Blair’s expedition is returning
from the rear; they went within sixteen miles
of Yazoo City, but old Joe was nowhere to be found.
A division has just come down from above. I wrote
home today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 5.</span> Friday. All quiet today, I went out
with Boggs and picked some blackberries. At dusk
I went up to look at the fort, and after dark got
over to look at the “land gunboat” as it is called.
Frank went over to the Point after some of the
Captain’s things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 6.</span> Saturday. There was a little skirmish
last night on the left. Drove in the Rebel outposts
and captured one prisoner. A number of deserters
came in today. Six siege guns are coming up from
the river. Today is the quietest we have had since
we took up our position before the town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 7.</span> Sunday. Up early, regiment formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
and went out skirmishing. The Rebels command
a hollow which we were obliged to cross. They
poured in quite a fire, but no one was hurt. The
regiment came across all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 8.</span> Monday. The company formed before
daylight and we crossed the exposed hollow before
light, leaving three men at the rifle pits. Artillery
firing tonight. Boggs and I went up to the big fort.
It is progressing finely. We were fired at from
there. After dark they had a regular moonlight
skirmish and in the fracas our “land gunboat” was
burned. We succeeded in running it nearly up to
the fort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 9.</span> Tuesday. Went back about one and
one-half miles with Doty and Boggs, got three
quarts of berries, and took a good wash. Very hot
and dusty. We are anxiously looking for rain.
Our eighty-four pound siege gun has arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 10.</span> Wednesday. We had not more than
finished our early breakfast when the flood gates
of heaven, with all its artillery opened. The rain
poured down on our houseless heads in torrents.
We covered up our things with oilcloths as best
we could and sat on them to keep them dry. Some
of the boys were located in the ditch, but they
were doomed to a complete rout. The water came
sweeping down in torrents, bearing shanties, rails,
and every obstruction before it. The ditch was no
sooner filled than it overran the bottom, sending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
the occupants skadaddling to higher ground. It
rained all day in showers, not giving us time to dry
our blankets. It has most effectively laid the dust.
The Rebs have taken advantage of the rain and
tried to plant a battery, but our artillery poured in
round after round, slightly deranging their plans.
We have our eighty-four pounder mounted. Was
detailed for guard at the ammunition magazine just
before night. We had another heavy shower after
dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 11.</span> Thursday. It cleared off in the
course of the day but the ground is muddy. We
had another man wounded today, making thirty-nine
in all. Our big gun threw over some shell
and did splendid work. Our division has about
forty cane breakers, none from our regiment. They
have to work at fatigue. There is talk of working
them into a pioneer corps. It is reported that
Grant has gone up the Yazoo and left McPherson
in command. McPherson is gaining the good will
of his corps rapidly. He is almost universally
liked and esteemed. We were relieved early and
returned to camp. I exchanged my minnie for an
Enfield.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 12.</span> Friday. Some artillery along the
line. The old gun occasionally sends over its dirt
disturbers. We have had a beautiful day. The
Rebs sent over a few shells, one of which burst
over our regiment, but hurt no one. Doty, Schultz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
and I went after blackberries this morning. I got
five or six quarts. Troops are coming up the landing
and going up to the Yazoo. Huron’s command
went up yesterday. They had an engagement at
Milliken’s Bend. Negro troops were in action and
are reported to have done well. Frank Bishop was
killed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 14.</span> Sunday. Another fine day. Rebs
unusually active, throwing shell. They have one
gun that is causing us considerable trouble. It is
back in the rear and our artillery cannot disturb
it. I wrote home today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 15.</span> Monday. We were aroused at 3
o’clock this morning. The company was formed
and went out sharpshooting. The enemy were
rather quiet, but they had a piece of artillery or
mortar directly opposite from which they sent over
shell all day. It was out of sight, but we had our
artillery loaded and ready and as soon as we could
see the smoke from their guns the shells were put
in from all directions. A number burst prematurely.
They killed Milligan of Co. A, and
wounded three others. Boggs got a slight rap. It
hit his gun first and spoiled that, and then hit him
on the arm. As soon as it was dark we struck up
a conversation. Uncle Ben and four of the others
went down and met an equal number of Confeds.
They had quite a chat, but could get no satisfaction
from it. They say they have lain in rifle pits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
nearly a month. The 36th Miss. is opposite us.
They all tell us the Tenn. and Mo. troops are kept
in the rear because they cannot trust them on the
outposts. Two or three deserted and came over
to headquarters last night. They showed three
days’ rations, it would have done for one meal, such
as it was—a small strip of thin pork and a chunk
of bread baked out of peas. They came to the
conclusion they would rather die cowards than
martyrs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 16.</span> Tuesday. Up at 5 o’clock and returned
to camp. Doty and I started for blackberries.
I picked a gallon. Davis got an order
for flour and sugar. Ragan baked pies. Frank
and I got a letter from home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 17.</span> Wednesday. Cool and pleasant.
Rebs threw over a good many shell from their
guns. We always knew when it was coming for
it was heralded by six or eight shots from our
batteries. I helped make out muster rolls today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 18.</span> Thursday. I worked at muster rolls
almost all day. About noon I was agreeably surprised
to be accosted by Pat Gallegher and George
Hissung. Pat is Captain, and George is about to
be Second Lieutenant. I was extremely glad to
see them. They both look the same as ever and are
bodyguards of Smith, who is on our left. Frank
got a pass and went over to Hovey’s division to
find A. B. Knight, but he was wounded at Champion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Mills, caught and paroled by the Rebs and
sent north, and I expect by this time he is at home.
He was a good soldier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 19.</span> Friday. We were called from our
slumbers by bursting shells and they continued to
come at regular intervals all day. They were
shrapnel filled with a handful of small balls, which
rained down in a perfect shower among us, but
fortunately no one was hurt. Their guns are in
hollows and used as mortars out of range of ours
and we can do no better than let them shoot. A
good many of our boys are burrowing into the
hillside. We received the melancholy news last
evening of the death of Dare. Poor fellow! he
was a good soldier and a true patriot. One shell
from the Rebs’ old mortar fell directly into the
tent of Stolbrand (chief of artillery on Logan’s
staff) bursting in the ground, tearing everything
to pieces, and scattering dirt on the writing desks
in other tents, but strange to tell, no one was hurt.
Stolbrand was out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 20.</span> Saturday. Last night deserters came
in reporting another massing of troops, and about
2 o’clock in the morning our brigade formed and
were ordered up to the rifle pits. The pits were
filled without Co. K, and we marched back to camp
as reserve, so I lay down and slept until morning.
About 4 o’clock Logan’s old whistling Jack sent
over its eighty-four pound messenger. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
the signal for the whole line to open. From six to
eighty-four pounders now united in pouring over
a perfect shower of shell on doomed secession. This
continued until 10 o’clock, six long hours. When
we were through they opened their old mortar
and another gun. The shell from the small gun
burst over our brigade, throwing numberless pieces
among us. One shell struck on the left of the 7th
Mo., in the midst of a crowd standing around a
well. They immediately fell down and rolled away.
The shell burst, tore up the ground, and hurt no
one. Such accidents are constantly occurring, but
the boys are not always so fortunate. We partly
expected a charge today. Sappers and miners are
digging into the fort; we can see them from above.
Gen. McClernand is relieved and O. E. Ord takes
command of his corps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 21.</span> Sunday. We were ordered out at
3 o’clock for skirmishing. We had a six pounder
planted between Co. C’s pits and ours. Johnny
Moe, 1st Lieut. Co. C, was shot through the leg,
and had it taken off. The Rebs continue to be quite
active and use their mortar considerably. One of
their shells struck one of our big guns, beside
which one of the Generals was standing. It
glanced down the side opposite him, battering the
carriage, but hurt no one though it exploded. There
is a place between picket post and camp where five
or six Red sharpshooters have a fine range. Mail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
came in early this morning. I received letters from
Uncle P., Aunt C. and Rosalie. Papers also came
in, and with them the report of another invasion of
Pennsylvania. Report said the Rebs were already
at Chambersburg. I got a pass and went over to
Smith’s division to see Hissung and the boys. I
found them all well but Bill H. I had a good
time and returned to camp the middle of the afternoon.
Two men were wounded in camp today. We
had roll call this evening. Gen. Johnston has at
last crossed the Black with a force variously estimated
at from thirty to seventy thousand. Divisions,
brigades, and batteries are being detached
and sent to meet him. It is reported that Grant
and McPherson have gone to the rear in person.
If the Rebs wrest Vicksburg from us now they
must pay dear for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 23.</span> Tuesday. Sweeny and I went to
work remodelling our shanty this morning and at
11 o’clock were detailed on fatigue to fix Gen.
Logan’s bomb-proof underground cellar. We finished
it about noon. I took a knife from his
culinary department. The regiment was called on
for numerous details of fatigue duty today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 24.</span> Wednesday. I was awakened about
10 o’clock last night by the roars of artillery and
musketry. An incessant fire was kept up for two
hours. We learned today that the Rebs made a
sortie but were driven back. They wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
hinder us advancing our lines but did not succeed.
Day before yesterday I saw some of the cavalry
bring in ripe peaches and green corn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 25.</span> Thursday. We hear the forces in
our rear have had a slight engagement. Our forces
fell back until they had their position and then
repulsed the Rebs and drove them back in confusion.
The cheering and acceptable rumor of the
capture of Port Hudson has reached us. It is said
to be official. The latest news from the east is that
the Rebel raid is rapidly progressing and they are
within forty-seven miles of Harrisburg, the capital
of Pennsylvania. Lee and his generals are surely
adopting Napoleon’s tactics. It yet remains to be
seen whether they have the genius to carry out the
bold and fearless plans. It is now 2 o’clock. The
artillery is getting busy, and it is rumored that we
shall have work before night. The brigade was
formed in rifle pits at the brow of the hill. Gen.
J. Leggett’s brigade was formed in the rear of the
fort. We lay here an hour before the explosion
took place. It was followed by four others that we
could see, and a general opening of artillery along
the whole line, and also the mortars and gunboats
and fleet. As soon as it occurred, regiments filed
up parallel with the fort and poured a close and
deadly fire into the enemy’s face. Hand grenades
were freely used on both sides. We lost severely
and did not accomplish our object. The fault must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
have been the engineers’. The fort was not destroyed,
the concussion was not near what we
expected it would be. We lay there all night. The
throwing of hand grenades was kept up. At dusk
I went and drew a new gun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 26.</span> Friday. We were ordered out on
picket early this morning. The Rebs on our front
were very shy. I only caught an occasional glimpse
of them, but fired fifty rounds, mostly at their port
holes and works. A good many shells and pieces
came among us, but no one was hurt. Our boys at
the fort had warmer work and finally fell back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 27.</span> Saturday. There were a number
wounded this morning and ambulances continually
passed through camp. The day is hot and sultry.
At dusk Doty and I went within a few feet of the
Rebels’ fort. We have sunk another shaft and are
again undermining their works. We climbed the
observatory and took a good look at Vicksburg, the
river, and its surrounding works.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 28.</span> Sunday. Hot and sultry. Went
after blackberries alone this morning and picked
four quarts. Had a good wash and returned to
camp. Johnston gradually closing up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 29.</span> Monday. Hot and sultry, and very
dusty. Rebels unusually quiet. News from the
east very meager. Hooker has ordered a seal to
be put on the press, but from what we can hear a
terrible battle is imminent. May the great Ruler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
of the Universe grant us success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 30.</span> Tuesday. Hot and sultry. Our regiment
was paid this morning. I received twenty-three
dollars. A stoppage of three dollars for the
premium which Phelps paid me at Memphis was
detached. Co. L, 2nd Ill. Vol. Artillery came in
this evening with rifles and James guns, direct
from Memphis. It is the same battery which was
sunk in the river this side of Grand Gulf while
crossing over. They had occasion to stop below
Lake Providence and shell a squad of Rebs. Our
regiment is not in as good health as a week ago.
This evening we were ordered out for picket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 1.</span> Wednesday. Regiment out on picket,
but I worked at pay rolls. The brigade was formed
and preparations were made to blow up the fort.
I went over the hill and up the hollow to watch
for the explosion. I waited a moment before the
shock of the explosion was felt, and it looked as if
the whole inside of the fort was torn out. It threw
out several people, one Negro was thrown a hundred
and fifty feet, lighting on his head and shoulders,
scarcely hurting him. He attempted to run
back, but a half dozen leveled muskets brought him
back. He and others were digging on the inside
to weaken the blast, which it did to a considerable
extent. No charge was attempted and all resumed
the old quiet again. The regiment returned from
picket after dusk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 2.</span> Thursday. Mail came in late last
evening. Got a letter from Father, Mother and
Rosalie. I went after blackberries and picked a
gallon. I had a good wash. Nothing of interest,
but a good many shells which the Rebs threw over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 3.</span> Friday. There was a brisk skirmish
on our left last night. The Rebs came out of their
works and attempted to drive in our picket, but
were driven back with a loss of nearly one hundred
men whom they left on the field. At 10 o’clock a
flag of truce came out and the bearer was escorted
to Gen. Grant’s headquarters. As to the object,
every one has his own opinion. I hope to Heaven
it is to propose terms of surrender. Most of the
boys think it is to bury the killed of last night.
Neut. Davis and I took advantage of the cessation
of hostilities and crossed the hill to the old fort.
We slipped the guard and reached the far end of
the works within a few yards of those of the Rebels,
who lined their parapets as far as the eye could
see. We stood face to face with them, almost near
enough to shake hands, yet not a word was spoken
on either side until their officers ordered us down
as we were inspecting their works too closely. Gen.
Leggitt ordered us to go outside the guard and their
officers drew off their men. Hostilities were suspended
until 2:30, when a few shells came over
and burst, banishing for a while our fond illusions.
But at 3 o’clock! Hail Columbia, Happy Land!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Vicksburg is ours! General rejoicing along the
line. Gen. Grant and his cavalry are to go in and
capitulation commences. Thus ends one of the
most brilliant campaigns the world has known
since the days of Austerlitz. No one but Napoleon
has equalled it. It has resulted in the complete
destruction of the Rebel army at Vicksburg. They
have lost without doubt about forty thousand men.
The boys are beginning to think Grant is a Napoleon.
He has completely wiped out his Shiloh
affair. Papers of the 29th in camp show very discouraging
news from the East. The Rebs are
throwing heavy columns into Pennsylvania, and
are threatening Pittsburg, Harrisburg and Baltimore.
Northern papers give no account of the
army movements. Hooker has been superseded by
Gen. Meade of the 5th Army Corps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 4.</span> Saturday. The sun rose bright and
clear to usher in this most eventful day to the
American people, but a sad accident happened
early in the morning, which served to mar in no
slight degree our rejoicing. A shell which had been
lying around the quarters for two weeks with the
cap taken off and most of the powder knocked out,
and some of the time filled with water, was put in
a post fire with the intention of scaring a certain
shaky individual, and had been forgotten. Dreggs
of Co. E lit it and watched the post fire burn for
a while and then he picked it up and carried it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
and threw it over into the quarters. It no sooner
touched the ground than it burst, and as good luck
would have it, only one man was hurt. Brown, of
Co. E, a fine fellow and a good soldier, was hit in
the side, it going through and tearing off part of
the lung. He lived but a short time. At 10 o’clock
terms were concluded. The Rebs are to be paroled
and the officers are to retain their side arms and
personal property. Between 10 and 11 o’clock the
Rebs marched outside and stacked their arms, after
which they returned to camp. At 2 o’clock the
troops on the left began marching in. At 3 we
formed, and after marching a while in the broiling
sun and suffocating dust, our division moved in
and up to the courthouse. We passed a large number
of Confeds. They are as good a looking set of
Reb. troops as we have seen. Most of them are glad
they have surrendered. Only a few look sober and
sullen. They had holes dug into the side hill to
protect them from our shells. They look as if it
were a sorry 4th of July for them. Their burial
grounds in the different hollows testify to the number
they have had killed. The ground back of their
camps is badly torn up by our mortars, the trees
are all marked up, and the limbs cut off by our
shot and shell. Minnie balls, whole shells and
pieces, and solid shot cover the ground. They have
defended the place bravely and I say “All honor
to them.” We marched around the courthouse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
stacked arms, and lay there about three hours.
Citizens had nice little caves dug into the banks
where they took their families and lived during
the siege. The mortars have nearly destroyed the
town. Large buildings were torn to pieces, each
by a single shell. Some went straight through,
and some exploded inside and tore them. A few
citizens were killed. Citizens are moving back to
their ruined dwellings. They look down-hearted
and sad, I suppose that in their hearts they wish
that the ordinance of secession had never been
passed. Two shells struck the courthouse. One
took a pillar from the observatory and just nicked
the roof as it descended. The other passed down
the roof, burst, and killed eighteen. Some of the
boys, together with several Confeds, broke into a
store and stole a large quantity of tobacco and
some other things before the guard came around.
A number of gaily dressed Confed officers passed
us, among them being Col. Montgomery, chief of
Pemberton’s staff. The Confeds and our boys
mingle together like old friends and have apparently
forgotten that but a short time ago they were
engaged in deadly strife. About 6 o’clock we were
formed and marched back and camped inside the
works, close behind where their old mortar had
been fired. Also where their big siege gun had
been planted and was afterward dismounted. The
ground around the two pieces is all torn up by our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
shot and shell. I went up to the right and saw a
beautiful English gun which our boys used to call
“Whistling Dick.” It is a Whitworth and some of
the Confeds told us it was the gun they had at Fort
Pemberton, that sunk the Chillicothe. The works
are full of artillery, most of which they never fired.
I saw between the Whitworth and the fort, a distance
of three-quarters of a mile, twenty-eight guns.
Just at dark I was detailed to go over to camp and
help fetch the supper. The Rebs have been living
on one-fifth rations and are nearly starved. They
mingled with us freely and we have divided our
rations with them. They tell us they hope we may
never know want while life lasts. Some of their
regiments actually had mule meat issued to them
on the morning of the 3rd, and it was in market
at fifty cents a pound. We saw a shoulder of it
dressed. Details are at work picking up small
arms and accoutrements, of which they had a large
number. Each man had two guns, one new Enfield
(drawn since coming here) for long range and
sharpshooting, and the other loaded with cartridges
of their own make and fifteen buckshot, of which
each man had forty rounds. If we had charged we
should have lost heavily. We found glass bottles
filled with powder and balls, with fuses in the ends,
which were used as hand grenades. Grant dispatched
Sherman’s and part of Ord’s corps to the
rear this evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 5.</span> Sunday. Buck and I took a stroll
over the works to the fort that was blown up this
morning, returning about noon. While we were
gone the regiment moved camp down to the
hollows. We walked around the works with the
Rebs. They told us where their best shots were
fired, also where the most annoying ones came
from. They are very friendly and our boys treat
them well. I believe they will hate to fight us
again. They are very anxious to get home. Frank
and I went out and got a fly to put over our cook
shed this afternoon. The boys are gathering tents,
flies and cooking utensils from the different camps.
Our tents and dishes came up from the river this
afternoon, and the evening was spent once more
in arranging a camp and digging a well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 6.</span> Monday. I wrote home this morning.
At 9 o’clock our regiment was ordered out on
picket. We have a strong picket guard around
the works to keep the Rebs in. Our company was
out at the big fort which was blown up. My post
was on the parapet beside it. This fort commands
a view of the works on either side as far as the
eye can reach. In the afternoon Boggs and I went
over to our old camp and took a good wash. Nothing
of importance happened until about 5 o’clock,
when a thunderstorm passed over. It was preceded
by an awful wind which nearly blew me off
the parapet. Rebs drew rations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 7.</span> Tuesday. We were relieved about 9
o’clock and returned to camp. The day was very
hot and sultry. The Rebs are very anxiously awaiting
their parole so they can go home. We had news
of a skirmish in our rear; there were about two
hundred prisoners brought in. I saw the Reb today
who fired the grape and canister at us when we
were behind the log on the 22nd. He is a fine fellow
and gave our boys credit for making some good
shots. He was anxious to know if he had hurt any
of us. He said we had actually dismounted some
of their pieces with our musketry. It weakened the
spokes so that they would not stand the reaction
when fired. The pieces are all dented up by Minnie
balls. The top of his gun had been knocked off.
He is from Tennessee. He gave me the name and
rank of each of the generals we had captured at
this place. They are: Gen. Pemberton, Tenn.;
Maj. Gen. Smith, Va.; Forney, Ala.; Brigadier
Generals Hober, La., Lee, Va., Green, Mo. (killed),
Reynolds, Ga., Taylor, Ky., More, Ky., Wauld, La.,
Bowen, Mo., Vann, Tenn., Barton, Ala.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 8.</span> We had quite a rainstorm last night
and today it is cool and pleasant. The Rebs are
around trading the company sugar for coffee and
preparing to leave. Just after tattoo, orders came
around to be ready at 4 o’clock tomorrow morning,
armed and equipped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 9.</span> We were up and stacked arms early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
this morning and awaited orders but none came.
News came into camp this evening of a fight in
Helena. Gen. Price attacked the place with sixteen
thousand troops and came very near taking
it, but with the assistance of the old wooden gunboats
the Rebs saved the day and drove him back,
taking over a thousand prisoners. Price left his
killed and wounded on the field. The Negro troops
are said to have fought like tigers. The news from
the East is fair. Meade met the enemy at Gettysburg
on the 3rd and they are still fighting. It is
reported that he repulsed two of the grand army
corps under Longstreet and Hill. Rosencrans has
advanced and occupies Tallahoma, Bragg’s stronghold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 10.</span> Friday. We had another rain last
night, and the water ran into our tent. Doty and
I ran the blockades this morning and went over to
see our blackberry patch. I stopped at our old
camp on the way back and took a wash. We had
our berries baked into pies. Capt. Wheeler bought
a keg of beer this afternoon for the boys to celebrate
the victory. Nearly all of Co. K are drunk.
Columbus Patterson started home on his furlough
today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 11.</span> Saturday. We were aroused from
our slumbers at an early hour this morning, (between
3 and 4 o’clock) with orders to be ready to
move at 5 o’clock. Breakfast was over and we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
our canteens filled and accoutrements on at the
required time. The brigade moved up the road to
the main entrance and deployed in line. The Rebs
were formed in their different camps and marched
between our lines, were halted, brought to a front,
and ordered to unstring their knapsacks. Our
commissioned officers, except one to a company,
were set to work examining paroles to see if they
were genuine, and the baggage to see that it contained
nothing contraband. A number, when they
saw this, slipped out from the ranks and threw
away packages of powder. Our company picked
out of the ravine a dozen packages or more. Our
company was on guard along the line. We had a
guard to stop Negroes. It was a touching sight to
see some of them part from their masters—they
loved them sincerely. Very few besides the officers
had them. A few women passed out. The officers
carried their swords and revolvers slung by their
sides. I saw Gen. Pemberton, Maj. Gen. Bowen,
Brig.-Gen. Hebay, of the C. S. A. pass out. We
passed out some four or five thousand on this road.
The weather is hot and sultry. A sick surgeon
came out and while they were examining the regiment
he became worse. I brought him some fresh
water and he asked me to call on him, as he was
carried back to a small tent on the hill in plain
sight. I did so after we were relieved, and took his
Nig to camp with me and sent him back with warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
cakes and tea. About 3 o’clock I was on a detail
which was sent up the road to relieve a guard who
had been out since morning. We had been on post
but a few moments when we were relieved, and I
returned to my protegee. He had been in all the
eastern engagements, from the battle of Winchester
to that of Antietam, he having been with Stonewall
Jackson. He was perfectly familiar with all
the country around Winchester, Bunker Hill, Martinsburg,
Williamsport, and Harper’s Ferry. He
was an assistant surgeon in Gen. Ewell’s division
hospital, and helped amputate Gen. Ewell’s leg
above the knee, at the second battle of Bull Run.
He complimented our eastern troops quite highly,
and also Gen. McClellan. He said he heard Jackson
and Lee say that McClellan was the man they
feared most. He was speaking of what a cruel
thing this war was and remarked that most of his
friends and relatives were in the North, his mother
was in Warsaw, Ind. There I halted him, as a
matter of course, and let him know our Indiana
company was raised in that identical place. He
made a good many anxious inquiries, but I was
not enough acquainted in that city to give him
any satisfactory information. He afterwards spoke
of Havana, Ill., and said he had practiced medicine
in that town. He was greatly surprised when I
told him our company was from Havana, Mason
County, Ill., and he was acquainted with a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
many of the boys as I named them over. I bolted
off for the company and sent up Boggs, who was
much surprised to hear that his father’s old partner
was a prisoner in our hands. Papers of the
7th came in this evening, bringing enthusiastic
accounts of a great battle and victory of Gen.
Meade’s army over the Rebs under their gallant
General at Gettysburg. Gen. Meade’s dispatches
proclaim a great victory and the utter rout of the
Rebs, with heavy losses of prisoners and colors.
A boat came up from Port Hudson this evening,
bringing news of the surrender of the place and
garrison. Hurrah for Banks!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 12.</span> Sunday. After dinner, roll call. I
mounted a mule which the boys had caught and
saddled, and started for town. The place is very
quiet. At the wharf you can see transports as far
as the eye can reach in either direction. The river
is quite low. I came around the Rebel works and
in coming back was surprised to see so little artillery
commanding the river. Only four guns and
one mortar, and a one hundred and twenty-eight
pounder, manufactured in Richmond, Va. In the
land defenses from the river to the English
Whitworth gun there are twenty-six pieces, making
in all from Fort Hill around to town fifty-nine
guns. Most of the troops have gone to the rear
and there is less than an army corps here at the
present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 13.</span> Monday. Our forces in the rear are
gradually closing up and skirmishing near Jackson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 14.</span> Tuesday. The paymaster is here,
working on the pay rolls and quarterly returns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 15.</span> Wednesday. A heavy detail from
our regiment was dispatched to work on Fort Hill
today. They are gradually changing the looks of
that once important fort, from a rude, unshapely
mass of dirt to large neat and substantial works.
This afternoon our boys, in filling up the hole made
by the blast, dug out a number of bodies. They had
been crowded into the hole and covered up. Heavy
details are at work repairing the old line of Reb
works, also in filling up and destroying our old
ones. The famous covered way from the White
House to Fort Hill is nearly destroyed. It seems
too bad to destroy the works that we spent weeks
of hard labor and exposure to construct. It seems
to us that they should stand as monuments for
future generations to look upon, but still we have
implicit confidence in the good judgment of Gen.
Grant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 16.</span> Thursday. I am on duty again today.
The duty is very heavy now as all the troops
excepting two divisions have gone to the war. I
helped unload ammunition today without any relief
and was tired out when night came. They are
running a large supply of ammunition back to the
rear as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 17.</span> Friday. Early this morning we
moved our camp over about one mile nearer town.
We tore down some houses to get boards for our
table and to fire up our mess quarters. About 1
or 2 o’clock we were paid again. I received forty-five
dollars and fifty-five cents. Frank and I expressed
home fifty dollars each. Stafford was
around and gave me a Secesh song written in the
ditches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 18.</span> Saturday. On duty at Fort Hill carrying
gabion baskets. Our old covered way
is nearly destroyed. I got some peaches and apples
today and we had some pies. I also had an ear of
corn, but it was too hard to be good. Couriers
came in today with the news that Joe Johnston
had cut through our lines and was retreating. We
get no late news from the East, and are on the
tiptoe of anxiety. I wish Grant was on the Virginia
side of that river for a short campaign.
Papers on the 11th are here but no news only that
Meade is concentrating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 19.</span> Sunday. Hot and sultry. Had
inspection at 10 o’clock. The order has come for
granting furloughs, two go from our company—G.
Ross and A. J. Van Auken. Got a Free Press but
no letters from home. Dress parade this evening.
A funny incident took place. One of the poor,
half-starved horses that overrun the camp, preceded
the band as it led the regiment, just in good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
kicking distance. We got the New Orleans Sun
the evening of the 15th. It has the particulars of
the surrender and occupation of Port Hudson with
five or six thousand prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 20.</span> Monday. Very hot and sultry. On
fatigue, digging a well for headquarters. Got a
number of papers which I culled from a cartload
of them. Two months ago today the siege of Vicksburg
began and was continued through forty-seven
long, dreary days, and ended that glorious old day,
the 4th of July.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 21.</span> Tuesday. Boats came in last night
and brought Northern papers of the 14th. No
particular news from the East, only Meade concentrating
at Hayes. John Morgan is making a
raid into Indiana. I hope he will succeed in arousing
the people and then get himself captured. No
news today from the rear. Jim Chesher came in
this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 22.</span> Wednesday. The furloughs have come
this evening, approved. I send this north to be
mailed by D. D. Ross. Our regiment registered
two hundred and ninety men at the beginning of
the siege. The day of the charge and other days
while skirmishing and sharpshooting, our loss,
killed and dead from wounds, was fourteen, forty
wounded, making an aggregate of fifty-four, over
seventeen per cent.</p>

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
